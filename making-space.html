        <i>Abstract</i>  How might knowledge generated through spatial praxes be rendered without being flattened, georeferenced, or vectorized? This presentation introduces negative-spaces.github.io, the digital space I am building to convey my master’s research in a form akin to the rhizomatic process of its creation and the interconnectedness of intellectual and spatial topoi which lure me to disoriented discovery. I will demonstrate how my theorization of deep mapping––constituted through my practice of deep mapping––is enacted in both the construction and structure of negative-spaces.github.io. Deep mapping does not counter cartography; it is not defined by opposition so much as through acts of iterative interference. Deep mapping is thus a tactic for transgression. By locating my thesis output in negative space, I aim to refocus attention from within the field to other/ed modes of engaging with place, producing geographic knowledge, and rendering spatial research public.<br>
