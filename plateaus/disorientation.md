# disorientation
I have come to understand being a geographer as less of an ability to know where you are in space at all times and more **the capacity to learn through disorientation**. Like many colleagues, I began graduate school in a place I’d never been before and where I knew no one. 

Coming from physical geography and geographic information science to human geography

Journey here - driving cross country without linear plan; no mental map of vancouver before arrival 
    
    My application statement submitted to UBC in January 2021:
    I am a renaissance student whose skills in the arts and sciences unite in Geographic Information Science. My research interests lie in GeoVisualization, Critical Cartography, and the Geohumanities. I value both qualitative and quantitative methodologies, and am especially drawn to the ways both practices supplement each other. The research streams Digital Geographies, Geospatial Analysis, GIS and Knowledge, Ideas, Practices are both of interest to me for I seek the technical skills to map transdisciplinary patterns, not just conceptualize them. While my undergraduate background is in the physical sciences, I am fundamentally a creative whose passion lies with critical examinations of people, their interaction with each other, and response to the natural and built environment.

As teaching assistant for a departmental cartography course, I was responsible for introducing and evaluating assignments, as well as demonstrating the use of required software. The first assignment: to **make a map of downtown Vancouver by tracing a screenshot from Google Maps in Adobe Illustrator.** I graded sixty of these maps before I finally ventured to the place they represented. Having now inhabited Vancouver for nearly two years and taught this assignment nine times, I find Google’s map incongruous with my mental map of the city drawn from lived experience. Navigational maps, writes Laura Kurgan, “impos[e] a quiet tyranny of orientation that erases the possibility of disoriented discovery. . .” (2009, 16-17). 


## Tyranny of orientation, the fixation of trace
>"It seems as though in the end, maps–—the successful ones, the ones that show us where we are and get us from here to there–—risk offering only two alternatives. They let us see too much, and hence blind us to what we cannot see, imposing a quiet tyranny of orientation that erases the possibility of disoriented discovery, or they lose sight of all the other things that we ought to see. They omit, according to their conventions, those *invisible lines of people, places, and networks that create the most common spaces we live in today.*" (Laura Kurgan, 16-17 from Close up and at a distance, emphasis mine)

>"It is true that the operations of walking on can be traced on city maps in such a way as to transcribe their paths (here well-trodden, there very faint) and their trajectories (going this way and not that). But these thick or thin curves only refer, like words, to the absence of what has passed by. **Surveys of routes miss what was: the act itself of passing by.** The operation of walking, wandering, or "window shopping," that is, the activity of passers-by, is transformed into points that draw a totalizing and reversible line on the map. They allow us to grasp only a relic set in the nowhen of a surface of projection. Itself visible, it has the effect of making invisible the operation that made it possible. These fixations constitute procedures for forgetting. **The trace left behind is substituted for the practice. It exhibits the (voracious) property that the geographical system has of being able to transform action into legibility, but in doing so it causes a way of being in the world to be forgotten.**" (de Certeau 1984, 97)

**Spatial awareness** of my surroundings has evolved not by following Google's Map from A to B or memorizing its aerial contours, but rather through becoming lost and wandering around. Thus disoriented, I find areas of familiarity connected in surprising ways. 

Vignette: getting to wise 3 different ways, taking 33 bus

```
        I take the 33 bus to campus on a whim. I'm running late to teach and I don't want to deal with the hassle of Broadway construction. Why have I never taken the 33? I wonder as a 5 minute walk brings me to a deserted stop. I sit on a bench in the sun to catch my breath a moment. The 33 is one of the smaller buses. Its seats have that soft fabric patterned like a roller rink carpet. Riding the 33 is outside my routine. Its route takes me through places I've been before but have yet to connect via this navigation. ("I didn't realize the WISE was so close to Commercial! I came a different way last time. Oh, I remember walking through this park though! Okay, now I know where I am and where the WISE 'really is.'") The city is daily reinvented in my imaginary. Though far from Venice, I could fill a book with each page a different Vancouver. The city emerges for me not through place making alone but from connections - spatial relationships - drawn by my moving in/out/through/between/among areas of familiarity.

        Navigations articulate a mental map of place. And, though forever evolving and contingent, as the  field becomes more densely networked with/through unique connections, specific areas or spots become more anchored in relation to one another. In this way, navigation makes navigable. (I can trace in my mind at least10 pathways to travel from where I stand to Centerm Shipyard. And that's as a human – the urban field to a crow or a pair of chasing squirrels is another.) For me, spatial awareness of the place I inhabit - that geographical field of my encounter - develops through the embodied spatial practices of everyday navigations.  

    I wrote these thoughts initially in the whitespace of *A brief history of my body* by Billy-Ray Belcourt. Around the margin, in the negative space of another story. Each time I leave home I carefully select which books to bring with me, not because I will necessarily read them, but more because I like their company. I bring along the people/stories/concepts I wish to think with for the day. Often I bring more than one book. I like to put texts into conversation first amongst themselves. In my bag they interlap, folding together like a pair of hands. Opening one, I open myself: read me.  --> Intertextuality! Diffractive Reading!!

    More recently I boarded the 99 bus with Critical Concepts for the Creative Humanities. I brought this book because each concept is but a few pages - the distance between City Hall and MacDonald if you ride the 99 along Broadway. It opens to where I'd hastily tucked a crayon, to a page I'd never before been: Navigations. 

        "...navigation entails the production of a performative cartography of a terrain, field, or domain that is constituted in the very act of its exploration" (Tuin and Verhoeff 2022, 137-139).

    Just as navigating the geographical field articulates a mental map of physical space navigations within a conceptual field articulate a theoretical framework - a cognitive conceptualization of an emergent web of connection at which my ideas tug and pull. 
```

I realize the city is not a fixed and inherently bounded object which pre-exists my encounter and which I, the geographer-researcher, may separate myself from in order to map from a distanced, exterior position. Rather, the city is physical-conceptual field whose emergent topology is performatively constituted through my everyday navigations.


What if the field were not a site separate from where spatial analyses are produced, maps rendered, and urban geography written? Bringing this orientation to the ground, as praxis, means assuming the field of encounter (the city, as encountered if you will) as **interlocutor.**

I invoke **research-creation** to initiate such a dialogue with the world, asking

```
What could it mean to think *with* place, to *feel* the city?
