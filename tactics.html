  <p>
    <!-- <span style="font-weight:700">TACTICS</span><br> -->
    Tactics are methods whose validity is measured by their applicability to the situation at hand (Roberts 2018). In <i>The Practice of Everyday Life</i> (1984) Michel de Certeau describes everyday practices such as talking, reading, and moving about as tactical, “ways of operating” the Greeks called mētis (xix). The tactics of everyday practices are opportunistic; appropriating the hegemonic system from within, such “surreptitious creativities” form a “proliferating illegitimacy” which resists the authority that seeks their administration or suppression (de Certeau 1984, 96). A tactic poaches the system. James Scott (1998) elaborates mētis as practical knowledge. In contrast with epistemologies that are abstract, general, and universal, practical knowledge is experiential, situated, and local (Scott 1998, Chapter 9). Appropriate use of tactics depends on experiential knowledge gleaned through everyday navigations of terrains physical, conceptual, and digital. In other words, tactics deploy practical knowledge. For example, over the summer a friend of mine asked if I would print my artwork on tote bags. Looking into numerous custom printing websites, it seemed that with the complexity of my designs and color palette, each bag would cost me over fifty dollars. Unsure what to do, I then remembered seeing blank canvas tote bags for sale at a nearby crafts store for three dollars a piece. I also remembered that as a kid, I'd gotten so into dinosaurs that with the help of my baba I'd printed my drawings on transfer paper and ironed different dinosaurs onto T-shirts. I thought, why not print my own tote bags? I soon began experimenting with clothing, printing on T-shirts I gleaned from giveaway boxes by the curbside or what I found in fabric recycling dumpsters. I printed my designs using my Epson Workforce-Pro 4740 printer I gound in an alleyway shortly after moving to Vancouver. In both field research and site creation, I employ tactics of bricolage––the poetics of ‘making do’ with what tools, skills, and materials are readily available (Roberts 2018a). Mapping deeply is the cultivation of spatial awareness - a practical knowledge of any given surround - and thus a practice of gleaning information that may (or may not) become useful later on. This page is an introduction to my tactics of practice and the ways in which they enact interference with hegemonies of knowledge production from within.

      Whatever is found in whatever landscape the gleaner-bricoleur happens to find herself at whatever time she happens to be there is potentially constituent matter of an assemblage-in-progress, the production of which may take a number of different forms (or none at all - the practice of gleaning-bricolage need not cede an 'output' for it to still count as gleaning and/or bricolage).

      My thesis, negative-spaces, this space and its constitutive files, come together as a bricolage of the fields of my encounter, an assemblage of multimedia made for multiple occasions. The process of writing each page is one of collaging writings, photographs, recordings, sketches, and notes across times and contexts of this project, attending to patterns of resonance as my writing through them sutures them together, articulating a topology that could just as possibly been otherwise. Even the paragraphs of text were not written linearly or for the dedicated purpose of any one page. Often I draw from writing written a year or more ago, or writing written in the name of another project. This page is in part constituted by efforts towards three other conference presentations. Indeed, writing abstracts relevant to sections of my thesis I have yet to write is a tactic I use to keep me motivated and writing my thesis. If an abstract is accepted (and even if not) the exercise of writing for a purpose other than my thesis frees me to write material that is actually explicitly for my thesis. Much of the labor in writing a page then is sifting through the tremendous amounts of data I created for myself, such as hundreds of audio recordings and tens of field notes journals and all the notes I take on my hard-copy literature printed and sorted into drawers I routinely re-organize.

        Dissecting urban blocks, streets and alleyways extend like asphalt riverbeds along whose shorelines the excess of human consumption accumulates for disposal. Along alleyways in the industrial area by my second home discarded matters compile useless abundances. The decadence of disposal is ripe with contamination––the unsuspected juxtaposition of discordant discourses. Synthetic combustion brews acrid smoke. Styrofoam disassembles into decomposing shit. Refuse dissipates particularly, triggering visceral responses like scrunched nose stomach churn and walking quickly away. Garbage is composition awaiting compaction. But not everything cycles and nothing will become the same again.

        Not only municipal waste compiles at the curbside, however. Residential curbsides are porous boundaries of property where belonging is in flux. Operating on denizens’ tacit knowledge of the city, matters deemed no longer fit for purpose are offered up as open-ended invitations for recirculation by passersby. Half my wardrobe I gleaned from cardboard boxes left on the sidewalk or by back-alley dumpsters, pinned to trees or tossed over fences. Found items incorporated into my everyday include a coffee mug, desk, stapler, and Epson WorkForce Pro 4740 printer found with a note reading: I STILL WORK.

      <p>
        Crafting a multimodal thesis requires an eclectic methodologicalism––a toolkit of practical methods that are fit-for-purpose (Roberts 2018a). In both field research and site creation, I employ tactics of bricolage––the poetics of ‘making do’ with what tools, skills, and materials are readily available (Roberts 2018a). For example, instead of learning everything about coding and styling webpages before building my site, I teach myself what I need as I go, often gleaning (copypasting) snippets of open source code (as is custom) that are relevant to what I am attempting in the moment. Each page of my website is differently designed depending on the type of content I want to display. For instance, negative-spaces/rhythmanalysis.html contains a multitude of images, so I learned how to make image grids from W3Schools web tutorials (“How To Create an Image Grid” 2023). When constructing the .html documents, I even glean from myself, copypasting fragments of form from one page to perform a similar function on another. I also glean from practical knowledge of Cartesian cartography and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). I learned to use Github and git through my job at UBC Library where I where develop and lead workshops on GIS, as well as provide one on one consultations. In consults, I am often required to troubleshoot technical workflows. This requires not that I know everything beforehand, but that I know how to find information relevant to the question at hand. Whether giving consults, working as a Teaching Assistant, or making reference maps for scholarly publications, I exercise computational thinking. This is a skill I learned in a programming course for GIS. Computational thinking is a problem solving technique that was taught to me as follows: decomposition → pattern recognition → abstraction → algorithm. The point is to approach a problem by deconstructing it into component parts, recognizing similarities and connections, identifying and representing the gist of what needs to be done, and creating a plan to do it. I use computational thinking in the iterative formation of negative-spaces to tackle tasks like transcribing voice recordings, scanning books, and organizing the physical copies of all my literature. The algorithms, or workflows I’ve developed as needed have become tactics singular to my process of creation.

    The eclectic toolkit of a bricoleur is needed to expand the field from within, interfering with systems and structures which delimit intelligibility not through oppositional strategies but with tactics appropriate to the situation at hand.

	-walk the alley with a medium (voice recorder, sketchbook, camera, etc) 
	-go outside and map something with paper and pen; map it again differently 
-choose one concept and free write for 20 minutes about it
-mindmap with sticky notes on the wall
-draw with chalk 
-write while sitting in a different location, with a change of view
-perform a dérive for a day 
-exchange ideas with a friend over coffee
-ride the bus without destination 
-hand-map something small scale and something large scale
-from a plaza or rooftop parkade, look down to the street and observe what flows below 
-stand midway across a bridge and observe movement in all dimensions 
-remain at an intersection for 10 minutes and notice what patterns and disruptions emerge </p>
