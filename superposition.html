        <i>Many stories exist in the landscape</i>, says a wooden frame erected at Jericho Beach Park, <i>What do you see?</i> Do different stories render different cities? Or is it, as so exquisitely suggested by Italo Calvino's Invisible Cities (1974), that different framings focus a city differently, evoking a multiplicity of stories, each one rendering some aspects of a landscape legible to the exclusion of others? 
      </p>

      <p>
        I am a bricoleur-as-researcher, conducting transdisciplinary investigations into everyday urban geographies through both affective and technoscientific research practices. I craft multimodal artifacts which perform bricolage with the physical-conceptual fields of my encounter. Through the course of my master's research-creation, I have explored and responded to the question: what could it mean to think <i>with</i> place? to <i>feel</i> the city? I have done so through deep mapping, or situated, embodied inhabitation as a practice of ongoing and open-ended dialogue within and as part of the world. Deep mapping does not counter cartography in the sense that it is not defined by opposition. Deep mapping is a capacious practice marked by iterative acts of interference with hegemonic forms of representing place, producing geographic knowledge, and rendering spatial research public. This, my theory of deep mapping, is constituted through my practice of deep mapping. I believe deep mapping to be a Baradian diffractive apparatus (Barad 2007), for at times it is the object of my investigation and at times, the instrument. Deep mapping has proved a means to investigate the entangled states of limit and transgression, as well as trace and practice. 
     </p>

      <p>
        My thesis, as the unzipped folder negative-spaces and the webbed site constituted through intra-action with the contents therein, marks a partial account of my deep mapping practice. Its articulation as an object of knowledge is the effect of multiple boundary making practices. What becomes intelligible as a thesis is not an innocent matter, for the constitution of a determinate form entails the exclusion of all other/ed possible configurations. Through the course of my master's research-creation I realized what is needed to produce 'situated knowledges' (Haraway 1988) of the place one inhabits is not reflexivity on the part of the geographer-cartographer-researcher, or merely an approach which counters the hegemonic one, but an account of <i>how</i> differences come to matter as the effects of interferences. I want to suggest "the city" as a phenomenon within which empirical formations (themselves phenomena) like spatial data and maps (be they mental or physical/digital) are intra-actively produced through both technoscientific and affective agencies of observation. 'Top down' and 'bottom up' mapping practices simply perform different agential cuts, the effects of which do not oppose one another but overlap in the everyday, their interference constituting the entangled viscera of urban bodies as they are rendered differentially intelligible. To study phenomena, their entangled states, and/or the apparatuses performing agential cuts from an exterior position, however, requires building a larger diffractive apparatus (Barad 2007, 345). This is what I intend to undertake as my next research project. I want to build a diffractive apparatus to study how the phenomenal city comes to differentially matter through the entangled effects of 'top down' and 'bottom up' boundary making practices. Reimagining referent "the city" from a fixed and bounded object to a phenomenon, dynamically figured through the posthuman performativity of 'iterative intra-activity' (Barad 2007), allows for a multiplicity of stories to be superpositioned in one place. The indeterminacy of which story comes to matter is resolved by boundary making practices which differentially frame the landscape. Accounting for boundary making practices is important in order to remain responsive to how some stories become privileged while others are "excluded from mattering" (Barad 2007, 220). 
      </p>

      <p>
        At this point I must ask, have I done this? Have I demonstrated a responsiveness to the ways in which my research-creation draws boundaries, figuring intelligibility as the effect of exclusions? In some ways, yes, I believe so. In negative-spaces/rendering.html, I tackled the boundary making practice of rendering my research public, exploring how the process becomes an interference praxis at once articulating boundaries and reconfiguring them. As prefaced in negative-spaces/disorientation.html, my research-creation question was open ended. My output marks a provisional response. I did not quite know where I was going when I began which, while allowing "time and space to <i>experiment in unpredictable directions</i>" (Loveless 2019, 70, emphasis in original) and "use my intuition by <i>feeling</i> my way through" (Fitzpatrick 2017, 64), meant many of the readings I found so relevant I encountered midway through my project. Some serendipitous findings I wish I had encountered sooner. My literature is sprawling and I am only just beginning to make connections. In my next endeavor I aim to be more intentional in gathering some readings beforehand, reading for a foothold in a few places so as to situate myself topologically within the conceptual field before I wander off into the unknown.

 <!--15 minute city interlude -->
     <!-- <div>
    <p>
      Much of my fieldwork has involved navigating Vancouver, my empirics emerging as inextricable layerings of sensorium, affect, and infrastructure. Alongside my thesis I have TAed a departmental cartography course as well as completed cartographic research assistance and freelance cartography. I also work in the university library Research Commons, teaching and consulting on geospatial matters as well as developing and facilitating workshops on mapping and geographic information systems (GIS). 
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the workshops I led for the library was on building walkability indexes with GIS (“Network Analysis,” n.d.). GIS, or geographic information systems, are the computational programs, desktop applications, and infrastructural hardware that facilitate the distribution, visualization, and analysis of geospatial data. Geospatial data are data for which a locational property, such as coordinate or street address, is measured. Much like excel assists in performing mathematical calculations on numerical datasets or Nvivo helps highlight patterns across qualitative records, GIS assist in performing spatial analysis on georeferenced datasets. A walkability index is a quantitative assessment of the relative accessibility of amenities within a delineated area. The workshop assumed as its empirics geospatial datasets which render the city down from above as a collection of points, lines, and polygons. Indeed, it is possible to make the  entire index without any reference to on-the-ground, everyday navigations. Given geospatial data representing Vancouver's city blocks, population density, and amenities, GIS provides the tools to analyze proximity and connection, as well as visualize the result through a map.
    </p>
    <p>
      Around the same time as I was preparing to present the walkability workshop, I began noticing these '15 minute City <span style="font-weight:500">Ready</span>' stickers popping up along the Vancouver Greenway, a stretch of the old Canadian Pacific railroad that's been transposed into a designated pedestrian and bike path. Conceptualized by city planner Carlos Moreno, the '15 minute city' is the idea “that cities should be designed or redesigned so that, within the distance of a 15-minute walk or bike ride, people should be able to live the essence of what constitutes the urban experience: to access work, housing, food, health, education, culture and leisure” (Moreno 2020). Over the course of the spring, more stickers appeared, pasted over DO NOT ENTER EXCEPT BICYCLES signs and those yellow/black striped hazard markers. At the same time that the stickers began proliferating east, west, and even across the bridge into downtown, they also began being scratched off. Reapplication, however, was swift. Then I sighted something different: at first one then two sites, scrawled in blue sharpie over '15 minute City <span style="font-weight:500">Ready</span>' was the declaration RESIST.
      </p>

      <p>
        But resist what? Well it turns out the '15 minute City <span style="font-weight:500">Ready</span>' stickers are actually in protest of the ‘15 minute city’––the decal’s chain-link background representing enforced limited mobility. The location and surface of the stickers' placement is therefore significant. The signification of protest comes to matter through the stickers’ material-semiotic interference with infrastructural boundary demarcations. City signs become palimpsests––sites of super/im/position signaling contested urbanisms. This led me to think about how proximity and connection are measured, the city imagined, and urban space produced through both technoscientific and affective spatial practices.
