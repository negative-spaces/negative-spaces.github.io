  <br><br>
  This section is the core of my theoretical elaboration. I explicate how, in my theorization, deep mapping is not defined by opposition so much as marked by (iterative acts of) interference. Drawing from an encounter at the beach and a year later with Karen Barad (2007), I argue that deep mapping is a Baradian diffractive apparatus for generating interferences and studying how the effects of these interferences come to matter. 
  <br><br>
  There are four sections to this page. The first section describes/diagrams superposition, interference, diffraction and interference/diffraction patterns. I then introduce Haraway’s deployment of diffraction as “an optical metaphor for the effort to make a difference in the world” (2018, 16). This connects to my first conception of deep mapping as interference with the superficial reflection of place represented represented by flat maps. 
  <br>
  However, diffraction is not a metaphor without material consequence. Indeed, diffraction articulates what matters. In the second section I introduce Barad’s agential realism from Meeting the Universe Halfway: quantum physics and the entanglement of matter and meaning (2007) and the diffractive apparatus. I then argue Deep mapping is a Baradian diffractive apparatus for exploring the entangled states of limit and transgression.

      Some grey day my first winter here I walked the stretch of shoreline that wraps around the University of British Columbia. With the Salish Sea on one side and a forest of evergreens and sword ferns to the other, campus is geographically and administratively separated from the city of Vancouver. It also occupies the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam) First Nations.  A five minute walk from the Geography Department takes me to a zig-zag staircase at the bottom of which awaits a place where clothing is optional. My shoes and socks are the first to come off. The sand is cold and firm, yet porous. It holds the impression of my soles and reshapes in my hands. I contain it for a moment - appreciating the texture of time and force - then let it go. 
    <br><br>
    Sunshine was a precious thing my first winter in Vancouver when it rained for four months straight. The cloud cover was so dense that a dimple of white was the only indication our star remained. Monochrome days used to really kill my vibe. There is a dullness to a landscape lit ambiently, a non-differentiation that makes it difficult to articulate thoughts. That day I paused at ocean’s edge where barnacles encrust the rocks and molluscs cling together in crunchy bundles. In and out rolled the waves, and I breathed with them. On each exhale I noticed how foam gathered around the rocks at my feet, forming bubbles on whose surface spun psychedelic spirals.

<br>
<p>
    This happens due to thin film interference, where light waves reflecting off the surface of a bubble are interfered with by waves which have been transmitted through the film, reflected back, and refracted at the surface at the angle of incidence.     [interference pattern - destructive and constructive -- superposition] 
    <br><br>
    [sketch reference diagram]
    <br><br>
    When refracted waves are shifted so as to be in-synch with those reflected, they interfere constructively to make visible an abundance of colors. Deep mapping is interference with the superficial reflection that is place rendered (down) by flat maps

  <p>DIFFRACTION<br>
        Interference pattern --> diffraction
        January 2022; First conception/theorization of deep mapping as (constructive) interference - stepping "into" the field as it were, diffracting, and interfering with superficial reflections (basemap) to produce a cartography beyond the monochrome. Diffraction is when a wave meets obstacle or opening --> passes through --> bends --> waves interfere --> diffraction pattern aka interference pattern.<br><br>

        My field cannot be instantaneously apprehended as the nominal City, nor can it be captured by the frame of a single map. Neither is one existing disciplinary framework or methodology sufficient: each time I leave home I bring along the people/stories/theories I wish to think with for the day. I put texts into conversation first amongst themselves. Heavy in my bag, their pages interlap, folding together like a pair of hands. Opening one, I open myself: README.md; Transform me. My field is the emergent web of connections drawing together (with) physical and conceptual topoi––a topology continuously transforming through intra-action. It is this relational entanglement that is at stake in rendering thinking through practice. <br><br>
