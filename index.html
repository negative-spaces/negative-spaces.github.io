      My thesis is a partial account of an ongoing and open-ended dialogue with the world initiated by my question: what could it mean to think with place? to feel the city? I investigate these provocations through deep mapping, a capacious practice of situated, embodied inhabitation which assumes the physical-conceptual field of encounter as interlocutor. Deep mapping does not render down to a flat map in the Cartesian sense; though neither does it ‘counter cartography.’ Deep mapping is not defined by opposition so much as marked by iterative acts of interference with hegemonic forms of engaging & representing place, producing geographic knowledge, and rendering spatial research public. Sometimes a site of interference sometimes a tactic, deep mapping is a Baradian diffractive apparatus for exploring the entangled states of limit and transgression. Or so it will unfold. . . 
    <br><br>
    negative-spaces.github.io and its constitutive code repository (per)form the output of my master's thesis in geography. Taken together, the web-field-site of my thesis output marks a praxis of interference while being itself the articulation of (systemic) interference as praxis. The pages of negative-spaces.github.io 1. introduce my practice of deep mapping 2. convey my theorization of deep mapping as generated through my practice of deep mapping, and 3. articulate how rendering my research-creation public enacts theory as praxis.

    My use of Github as a host platform was inspired by <a href="https://sultanazana.github.io/" target="_blank"> sultanazana.github.io</a>, whose “network of webpages will grow more tangled with time.” Conventionally used for managing code development for software projects, I chose Github as my host platform because it renders visible the iterative process of formation. github.com/negative-spaces/negative-spaces.github.io, the repository, contains the html documents which, once read by web browsers, comprise what’s read by browsers of this web-site. Each page of negative-spaces.github.io includes a link to its <a href="https://github.com/negative-spaces/negative-spaces.github.io/blob/4f81bb5238bcae5f708453aa44bec0f319ee76ae/index.html" target="_blank">constitutive html document</a>. In this way, process is embedded within the elements of product.

    Why negative-spaces? In visual art, negative space refers to that which surrounds the object but is not the intended focus of attention. Negative space gives definition to the intelligible form by being <i>other</i> than it. The site of interference is the boundary that differentiates. Never fixed, the limit is revealed in the instant when that which the intelligible form excludes shows up in the space of the intelligible. Interference at once articulates difference and redraws boundaries by bringing what was previously unintelligible into focus. Locating my research-creation in negative spaces brings to the fore modes of knowledge production that are institutionally rendered outside the norm. Making space for deep mapping is twofold: there is the form and formation of the web-field-site followed by its formal submission, acceptance, publication, and archival by cIRcle, the platform contracted by the university to publish graduate theses and dissertations. As it stands, the institution has never published an interactive digital site as a thesis and the platform is not configured to upload or archive such a format. Therefore, I am currently engaged in dialogue with the representatives from the university’s Graduate School, Library archivists, and cIRcle platform engineers to negotiate the formal technicalities of rendering legible (to the sociotechnical system of institutional publication) a web-field-site as thesis. While the form and formation of negative-spaces.github.io and constitutive repository articulate a practice of interference, rendering negative spaces visible from within the institution through publication as thesis enacts theory as praxis by reconfiguring “what gets to count as a valid object and method, within which disciplinary framework, where, when, and how"

      <span class="popuptext" id="myPopup">"research-creation suggests a mode of knowledge production that does more than simply contribute to existing realms of interdisciplinary and disciplinary data. Instead, without eschewing the asymmetries of hierarchical disciplinary differences, it tumbles outside of these intellectual frameworks, challenging practice/theory divides as they police what gets to count as a valid object and method, within which disciplinary framework, where, when, and how."  <br><br> Loveless, Natalie. <i>How to Make Art at the End of the World: A Manifesto for Research-Creation.</i> Duke University Press, 2019.

   One aim I set for myself in doing an MA in geography was to figure out what being a geographer meant for me specifically. Indeed, this may have been the one guiding question all along, in which case I’ve stayed true to my bearing. I have come to understand being a geographer as less of an ability to know where you are in space at all times and more of a capacity to learn through disorientation. My research-creation is driven by intellectual and spatial topoi which lure me forwards even before I comprehend where they lead (Loveless 2019, 70). As such, my thesis is process rather than destination oriented. Its a story of navigating the field of possibilities opened up when A and B are recognized to be but place holders like latitude and longitude. After all, iteration of a form reveals beginning and end to be merely places of turning and return.
