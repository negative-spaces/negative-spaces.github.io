            <p> My first view of Vancouver. The morning after I arrived, August 7th, I walked from 30th all the way down
                to the shore. I knew nothing of this place before coming here. I'd googled pictures of the city once
                back when I was deciding which offer to accept.
                <!--I could do a computational focused MSc. in San Diego, an professional program for cartography in the Twin Cities, a Geographic Information Science PhD in Texas, and a master's of applied geography in New Mexico.-->
                Each path led, in my mind, to a divergent trajectory. Who was I going to become? The pandemic began
                during the spring of my sophomore year of undergrad. Within 2 weeks my life radically altered and I
                decided to graduate the next year and go somewhere new. I spent a year isolated in rural Maine. It was
                there that I began walking in the woods, practicing something I called <a
                    href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/4ab243f6d7b3490bbfa884d18a788236">isolation
                    psychogeography.</a> Under the mentorship of my Intro to GIS teacher, the best teacher I've ever
                known, I explored critical and creative cartographies for my honors thesis. My undergraduate studies
                were in physical geography and geographic information science. I chose geography because, as seems to be
                common among geography undergrads in the states, I had an exceptional AP Human Geography teacher in UBC
                was the only MA program I applied to and though my final decision was on impulse, I think I felt the
                lure of openness to define my own project according to a mix of interests. And mentorship by someone
                who's skills and knowledge spanned a breadth of fields. Looking back on my research statement submitted
                this time two years ago (January 2021), my general aim remains the same:
                <br><br>
                <span class="quote">I am a renaissance student whose skills in the arts and sciences unite in Geographic
                    Information Science. My research interests lie in GeoVisualization, Critical Cartography, and the
                    Geohumanities. I value both qualitative and quantitative methodologies, and am especially drawn to
                    the ways both practices supplement each other. The research streams Digital Geographies, Geospatial
                    Analysis, GIS and Knowledge, Ideas, Practices are both of interest to me for I seek the technical
                    skills to map transdisciplinary patterns, not just conceptualize them. While my undergraduate
                    background is in the physical sciences, I am fundamentally a creative whose passion lies with
                    critical examinations of people, their interaction with each other, and response to the natural and
                    built environment.</span><br>

                i've inhabited this place for a year and a half now. i drove to vancouver from the other side of the
                continent via somewhere in the middle of the united states. for the first time in my life i left a
                familiar place without a plan. i had no map save a Rand McNally Atlas of U.S. Road Atlas which i am
                embarrassed to say i forsook in favor of googles maps. even then, however, my journey unfolded in ways i
                never could have imagined and so slowly, i became comfortable with being uncomfortable. with not knowing
                what lies ahead. so much can happen between departure and destination. yet when the goal of a journey is
                the destination alone, getting lost is experienced as an inconvenience. therefore, maps are used to plot
                a path from A to B, departure to destination. with digital maps such as google maps, GPS will geolocate
                you in cartesian space so long as you remain in range of satellite reception. follow the directions
                spoken in synthesized sentences and you won't ever have to feel disoriented. you can't get lost.
                [recalculating...] you can't get lost<br>
                <br>
                <span style="margin-left: 5%;">unless you exit the navigation,</span>
                <br>
                <br>

                    destination.</span>
                <br>
                <br>
                my journey to vancouver, into graduate school, and through this project until now has been a process of
                disoriented discovery. everything between departure and destination shapes where you end up. because
                deep mapping is process oriented research, so much of what went into articulating the negative spaces
                assembled above risks being relegated itself to negative space.to intentionally disorient oneself, to
                get lost as method, to slow down, to be guided by serendipity, to follow non-linear trajectories, to
                start something and start over. and over. and over and then claim that all this not only informs that
                which has coalesced as creative output but actually constitutes the research product is my commitment.

            <p>I lived in Dunbar for 7 months after I moved to vancouver. Dunbar is a neighborhood farthest west,
                separated from campus only by Pacific Spirit Park. To commute into the department my housemate and I
                would bike a few blocks to the park then through the woods until we came out at campus luxury
                residences. We'd ride the road, rounding two rotaries, then up one last slope to the main mall. Waving
                goodbye we'd coast the final way to our respective buildings. Where you live in the city matters for how
                you view it. It was a wealthy area of single families and dream homes with no architectural consistency.
                I lived in a tiny house from the 1920s with blackberries in the front and garden beds in the back. Five
                other people lived there, one which made it hell. Dunbar was far from downtown but close to the quieter
                beaches so I began going there after classes instead of home.

                Two months after I arrived in vancouver I began classes and TAing the undergraduate cartography course.
                My role as TA involved facilitating 3 lab sessions a week during which I'd introduce the assignment,
                demonstrate the use of Adobe Illustrator and ArcGIS, and troubleshoot questions. I also marked all 60
                students' weekly lab submissions, the majority of which were maps. The first lab assignment was to make
                a map of downtown Vancouver by tracing a screenshot from google maps. The rubric required land and water
                be differentiated by contour and color, a few 'well known' streets, and 5 points of interest which were
                given. The resulting map no practical use beyond an image. A tourist could not use it for navigation
                without referring to google maps. Which made me wonder whether these maps of the city reflected
                students' lived experience? And if not, what did they render? Or, rather, render invisible?

                I, like many colleagues and undergraduate students, had just moved here. Overwhelm dealing with
                household drama and academic demoralization it took me 6 months before I ventured downtown. I marked 60
                maps of a place I'd never been. They were arrangements of points, lines, and polygons for which I had no
                contextual mental map. By my third term TAing the class I'd walked nearly every street downtown. Before
                the first lab I invited students to spend 5 minutes sketching their mental map of vancouver. Nearly all
                were attempts at reproducing a memorized aerial contour. Areas of inhabitation or commute were more
                articulated/detailed. I think this is important somehow - the practice of connecting (with) your mental
                map before abstracting a place you know from on-the-ground navigation. It helps reveal what flat maps
                relegate to negative space. The required points of attraction I still haven't been to - and probably
                never will. They aren't what interest me.

                My first excursion downtown I took the 7 from Dunbar all the way to the waterfront. I was stuck on a
                term paper and figured disorientation might help. It did. I got off the bus somewhere by the shipyard
                and found a bridge (an infra/structure which has supported me since then). The following became the
                Prologue to that term paper:<br><br>
                <span style="float: left; margin-left:10%">
                    Where Main Street ends, at the boundary between Gastown and the Downtown Eastside, there is a
                    bridge. Well it’s more of a ramp really that curls around so the road never ends but continues by a
                    different name in a new direction. I found myself there the other morning, standing alone just
                    gazing towards the North Shore Mountains. It was clear and cold and snow had settled over their
                    jagged peaks in a perfect gradient. Before the mountains and directly below me spread a panoply of
                    infrastructure––Vancouver’s Centennial Terminals. Tower cranes, gantry cranes, straddle carriers,
                    forklifts, trucks, trains, train tracks, shipping containers, and pipes of iron and steel. Every
                    dimension was in motion. Machinery moved slowly and methodically while humans moved in erratic
                    zig-zags around the pavement. Some were operating the machinery while some machinery were operating
                    themselves. As a train drew in below me I peered down to see the conductor watching the switchboard,
                    prepared to take action in the event of system failure. But what happens when the train is your
                    argument and it fails to budge along the tracks you’ve set out for it to follow? In my case, I laid
                    down too many tracks. I got so swept up in constructing the possible paths this essay could take
                    that when I geared up to leave the station––to write it all out––I was paralyzed by the tangle
                    before me. Although a lifelong creative, my undergraduate background is predominantly in the
                    sciences and so thinking and writing academically within the context of humanities scholarship is
                    new. The infrastructure of a bridge holds sound because it is built not from one side over to the
                    other but from both sides at once. I want to act as a bridge between the arts and sciences and so I
                    have thrown myself from mountains, from geomorphology and erosion rates, over to a new shore (and
                    country) with cities and people and infrastructures to start building from another perspective.
                    Since arrival, I have been all around disoriented and not at all adept. My ideas are sprawling and
                    interconnected like Centerm shipyard. There is so much this city this class and these books have led
                    me to unpack and explore. For now, however, I am taking one final title, turning in one final
                    direction, and following a single train of thought to an end with the idea of infrastructure in
                    mind.

                I returned to that place on new years eve and watched the sun set in silent company with 2 strangers who'd had the same idea. I walked along the back street and sketched the city from behind.
