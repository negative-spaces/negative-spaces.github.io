quote on temporality 

remember f(x) formulation 

Barad "Temporality is constituted through the world's iterative intra-activity. Matter's dynamism is implicated in its production. Temporality is produced through the iterative enfolding of phenomena marking the sedimenting historiality ofdifferential patterns ofmattering"

i can use the same quotes in different places -- part of connecting in multiple ways

reference field notes within writing - another way to integrate field, practice, process

slow scholarship also because it takes longer to enter the field - light waves

sonic hum

presence is continuous (temporality, lefebvre, butler footnote) --> that must be why, since i began practicing presence on the last day of before christmas break in the car with magenta while we waited at a stopsign before crossing the street up to pine hill, moments seem always now - i am living (act, auxiliary) (live, infinitive) my entire life all at once. 



The question of how we might render rhizomatic spatial praxes without linearizing, flattening, or georeferencing is one I’ve been walking with recently. Deep mapping as I conceive of it does not counter cartography. It is not defined by opposition so much as through acts of iterative intervention with the basemap, established forms of knowledge production, and accepted ways of rendering research public.  The concept of deep mapping as constructive interference came to me while breathing with the ocean. The day was grey but at my feet I noticed foam forming bubbles on whose surface spun psychedelic spirals. This happens due to thin film interference, where light waves reflecting off the surface are interfered with by waves which have entered the film and re-emerged as refracted light. When refracted waves align with those reflected, they interfere constructively, intensifying the wavelength of light to make visible an abundance of colors. Deep mapping is constructive interference with the superficial reflection that is place rendered by flat maps. It’s situated, embodied inhabitation – a dialogue with the field of encounter. Off the page. Transformation through everyday navigations, relationships, conversations.

sprinkle insights from practice throughout instead of having one section where i describe all my practice, because thats just not it (could mention that in making space - no order - can read first if want.)

topoi loci foci

mindpalace is aka !!!!method of loci

dont like constellation term bc we draw these things between stars in teh sky but the stars are not on the same plane and actually it would look a lot different were we really to connect the stars

unintelligible until you shift focus, dissovel boundary you constructed in expectation 

web is all my navigations 
field is my map they constitute
i dont know what brought me this way or why im here
yet
intellectual and spatial topoi lure me to disoriented discovery
to sites of encounter unlocatable by coordinate or conceptual loci 
its a feeling a sensation a momentary communication 
resonance vibrates the web 
then im drawn on and the field shifts beneath my feet i slip somewhere different each step i take 
field of encounter always shifting, expanding, contracting, because i am always MOVING THROUH SITE  

>expanding field by expanding site of fieldwork, making web-field-site for deep mapping 

foci negative space 

deep mapping is an unitelligible dialogue
for I can only convey to you my part

not what you're looking for
shift foci 
the negative space 
site
its all the field 

theory as praxis


the map they constitue  navigations which constitute 
my field, the intellectual and spatial topoi which lure me to 
disoriented discovery themselves unlocatable by coordinate or conceptual loci 


sites of 
field -->  the intellectual and spatial topoi which lure me to disoriented discover 
themselves they have no one coordinate or conceptual 
loci --> rather sites of intersection of resonance I


is the dialogue of/in? unintelligibility 


cite my body site the field

"Although understanding is spatial in organization, it is not 
necessarily visual or tactile. All grasp of musical ideas, for example, 
involves perception of a gestalt.

One might say: ontological understanding is rooted in the 
perception of patterned resonance in the world.

Philosophy, practised as a setting of things side by side until the 
similarity dawns, is a form of ontological appreciation"

" Jan zwicky??? YES wisodm and metaphor - wow I remembered just from that citation where and what this was from !!! memory is spatial 

im trying to communicate a way of being and thinking and living inhabiting the world
where im coming from is living with magic in the world
i want to talk about the magic 
nd - experience of world
but its so far outside their imaginable way of being and thinking
it might always seem illegible

Deep mapping is a way of living spatially - being both of the world and accountable for 'intra-acting within and as part of the world in its differential becoming' (barad  2007)



### Rhythmanalysis
    Rhythm exceeds measure 
    Vignettes: monday night runners, reference back to bridge 
    Roberts - marooning - so cool!!!! 
    Bridge - feeling the city - bodily boundaries, de certeau on bridge

"...to grasp a rhythm it is necessary to have been grasped by it; one must let oneself go, give oneself over, abandon oneself to its duration" (Lefebvre, 27).
Like in music and the learning of a language (in which one only really understands the meanings and connections when one comes to produce them, which is to say, to produce spoken rhythms)."

# CRUXXXXX

compare AAG and symposium for sites of interference and tactics (DIFF omg doing what i did was a tactic -) but also CBD - no alley entrance

WOW the presentation of the research was part of the reasearch practice ---- make interference with research (diffraction) then study interferences made and patterns of simmilarity and diffrernece across them (diffractive apparatus revealing diffractive pattens) this is how deep mapping is diffraction
-- negative space - site constantly changing shifting boundary of intelligibile form limit of intelligibility 


Explain Barad's **Diffractive Apparatus** 
For them, Apparatus serves at times as instrument of investigation and at other times, object. but never both at once - complementary events. *Later on I argue my DM praxis is a diffractive apparatus and both a site and tactic of interference. the open question is, however, is it both at once? (superposition) and, most radically, apprehended as both at once? Theory and practice -- foucault says theory is practice. I would agree, and argue I put the theory I have so far into practice in instances of interference where the site is suddenly opened, and only later theorize deeper. but that doesn't discount the praxis (theory as practice) i was enacting in the moment.*

its all the field--- haraway nodes barad possibilities - situated knowledge - about framing.
