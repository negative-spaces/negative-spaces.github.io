                > How might knowledge generated through spatial praxes be rendered without being flattened, georeferenced, or vectorized? This presentation introduces github.com/negative-spaces/negative-spaces.github.io, the web-field-site I am building to convey my research-creation in a rhizomatic form akin to the interconnectedness of intellectual and spatial topoi which lure me to disoriented discovery. I will demonstrate how my theorization of deep mapping––constituted through my practice of deep mapping––is enacted in both the construction and structure of negative-spaces.github.io. Deep mapping does not counter cartography; it is not defined by opposition so much as through acts of iterative interference. Deep mapping is thus a tactic for transgression. By locating my thesis output in negative space, I aim to refocus attention from within the field to other/ed modes of engaging with place, producing geographic knowledge, and rendering spatial research public.<br><br>

        "It seems as though in the end, maps––the successful ones, the ones that show us where we are and get us from here to there––risk offering only two alternatives. They let us see too much, and hence blind us to what we cannot see, imposing a quiet <b>tyranny of orientation that erases the possibility of disoriented discovery</b>, or they lose sight of all the other things that we ought to see.

            <br><br>
            I have come to understand being a geographer as less of an ability to know where you are in space at all times and more of a capacity to learn through disorientation. Like many colleagues, I began graduate school in a place I’d ever been before and where I knew no one. As teaching assistant for a departmental cartography course, I was responsible for introducing and evaluating assignments, as well as demonstrating the use of required software. The first assignment: to make a map of downtown Vancouver by tracing a screenshot from Google Maps in Adobe Illustrator. I graded sixty of these maps before finally venturing to the place they represented. Until then, this part of the city was nowhere in relation to the city of my experience. Spatial awareness of my surroundings has evolved over the past year and a half not by following Google Maps from A to B or memorizing the contours it renders place down to from above, but rather through becoming lost and wandering around. Thus disoriented, I find areas of familiarity connected in surprising ways. The city does not exist as a defined and bounded object, a fieldsite which pre-exists my encounter that I, the geographer-researcher may separate myself from in order to map it from a distanced, exterior position. Upon taking multiple, different routes to a single destination, I  came to realize how my navigations performatively constitute the city as a physical-conceptual field of encounter.
            <br><br>
            How, then, might knowledge generated through everyday spatial practices be rendered without being flattened, georeferenced, or vectorized? This page introduces <span style="opacity: .6">github.com/negative-spaces/</span>negative-spaces.github.io, the website and constitutive code repository which I will submit as my masters thesis. Taken together, this web-field-site will convey what I’ve learned thinking with place in a rhizomatic form akin to the interconnectedness of physical and conceptual topoi which lure me to disoriented discovery. In what follows, I articulate how my theorization of deep mapping––constituted through my practice of deep mapping––is enacted in both the form and formation of <b>negative-spaces.github.io</b>.
            <br><br>
            Deep mapping does not render down to a ‘map’ in the sense of a cartesian cartography, where action is made legible by the substitution of trace for practice (de Certeau 1984, 97). It is a spatial practice whose actions eludes operationalization in their interpretive capaciousness, though becoming lost and wandering around is an excellent state wherein to begin. Mapping deeply attends to spatial anthropology, "the processes whereby the fundamental spatiality of being is woven into and from everyday practices, dispositions and experiential knowledge” (Roberts 2018, 30). For me, deep mapping is a practice of situated, embodied inhabitation through which I enter into dialogue with my surroundings. Pressing my chest against the Granville Bridge I feel at once its trembling vibration and my own heart’s rapid beating. I embody a sonic superposition: vibrational waves overlap; interfere; combine. The rhythm of their resulting wave marks a pattern of interference, of differential intra-action. In other words, a diffraction pattern.  Boundaries of bodies human and more-than are refigured during visceral encounter. I became entangled with the infrastructure which, heretofore, I had approached only as an instrument to support an abstract vantage for conducting rhythmanalysis of the field below. I leave the bridge holding a little of my warmth and bring away with me this idea. . .   
            <br><br>
            Deep mapping as I have come to theorize it does not ‘counter cartography’ (cf. Mason-Deese 2020); it is not defined by opposition so much as through iterative acts of interference with hegemonic forms of engaging/representing place, producing geographic knowledge, and rendering spatial research public. Understood this way, deep mapping is a diffractive apparatus for making interferences that matter (Barad 2007). It is an “ethico-onto-epistem-ological” orientation to geographic research which recognizes that “knowing, thinking, measuring, theorizing, and observing are material practices of intra-acting within and as part of the world” (Barad 2007, 90). Deep mapping disorients representationalist dualisms by assuming the field, in all configurings of encounter, as interlocutor. As such, the place with which I think cannot be instantaneously apprehended as the nominal (d & g) City, nor can it be captured by the coordinated frame of a single mapping. My city-field-site is drawn by lines of connection––a topology continuously transforming through intra-action. It is this relational entanglement that is at stake in rendering a theorization of practice, generated through practice.
