    <h3>Refocusing (from within) the Field: rendering negative space through deep mapping</h3>
    <p class="Courier">paper abstract for the <a href="https://2023.dhbenelux.org/">DH Benelux Conference</a> and outline for AAG conference paper following scheduled presentation on panel: Experimental Digital Mapping</p>
    <br>
    <p> How might rhizomatic spatial praxes be rendered without being linearized, flattened, georeferenced, or vectorized? In other words, without falling prey to “the (voracious) property that the geographical system has of being able to transform action into legibility” (de Certeau 1984, 97). My research practice of urban deep mapping eschews Cartesian cartography’s “tyranny of orientation” (Kurgan 2013), cultivating instead an embodied orientation towards place which unfurls through disoriented discovery. This paper is about negative-spaces.github.io, the digital space I am building to convey knowledge generated through practice and of practice, without operationalizing practice itself. I will show how my theorization of deep mapping is enacted in both the construction/formation and structure/form of negative-spaces.github.io––a space itself a field for the web flaneur’s deep mapping. Negative-spaces.github.io renders my master’s research in geography at the University of British Columbia, and will be complete in July 2023. A first draft will take shape in March 2023 as I prepare to present aspects of my work at the American Association of Geographers Annual Conference.
    <br>
    <br>
    I begin by outlining my theory of deep mapping and discuss how my tactics of practice in the city-field are also deployed in the creation of my web-field-site. First, theory. Well, theory constituted through practice and guided by a curiosity which cropped up along the way: What does it mean to think with place? To feel the city? My work is research-creation for the questions I ask “set[] up a dialogue with the world” and are driven by intellectual and spatial topoi which lure me forwards even before I comprehend where they lead (Loveless 2019, 95). Indeed, so grasped am I by the city’s rhythms I become Lefebvre’s rhythmanalyst (2013). Pressing my chest against the Granville Bridge I feel at once its trembling vibration and my own heart’s rapid beating. My body in visceral contact with that of the city––its infrastructure––I embody for some duration the city’s rhythm. In action I draw also from dérive (Debord 1958), the Situationist exercise of drifting about the city and allowing oneself to be pulled by urban geography’s affective contours. Deep mapping is a capacious practice, akin to those stubborn, unruly and resistant modes of walking the city which de Certeau argues “elude discipline without being outside the field in which it is exercised” (1984, 98). Deep mapping in my theorization does not ‘counter cartography’ (cf. Mason-Deese 2020); it is not defined by opposition so much as through acts of iterative intervention with institutionally-accepted forms of representing place, producing knowledge, and rendering research public. It is a diffractive methodology which assumes interference patterns––in my case generated intentionally as praxis––as both a tactic and site of knowledge production (Barad 2007). 
    <br>
    <br>
    Then, tactics. In both research and creation I employ tactics of bricolage––the poetics of making do with what tools, skills, and materials are around (Roberts 2018). Tactics are methods whose validity is measured by their applicability to the situation at hand (de Certeau 1984). Appropriate use of tactics depends on practical knowledge gleaned through everyday practices of navigating physical and digital geographies. For example, instead of learning everything about coding and styling webpages before building my web-site, I teach myself what I need as I go, often gleaning (copypasting) snippets of open source code (as is custom) that are relevant to what I am attempting in the moment. Indeed, it is through my job at the library––assisting in geospatial information and technology––that I learned to command the version control software I write with (git), and internet hosting service which renders visible my work (GitHub). 
    <br>
    <br>
    Next, I describe the form of negative-spaces.github.io and my intention behind each structural choice. My conceptual framework and theoretical contribution will unfold over many separate pages, woven into coherence by not one but multiple possible navigations. In this way, the space I construct to convey my research generated from deep mapping reflects the non-linear process of deep mapping itself and the interconnectedness of reference points in my field of encounter. To a newcomer, a navigational map of the city which renders (down) place from above as a mess of points, lines, and polygons does little to convey the embodied experience of inhabiting place. Sure, flat maps can be used to get from A to B, but I’ve come to understand that spatial awareness evolves not by memorizing the map but through taking multiple pathways, being open to detours, and exploring in (as yet) unfamiliar directions. Navigating articulates a mental map of place. And, though forever evolving and contingent, as the field becomes more densely networked with/through connections, reference points  become more anchored in relation to one another. The same is true for the conceptual field: following ideas in multiple directions reveals surprising connections that perhaps would not have become apparent had a 1:1 relationship between argument and evidence been enforced. Though beyond the scope of this paper, navigating in unfamiliar directions also exercises new neural pathways in the brain. What’s important for now, however, is this: though the physical and conceptual fields may at first be unfamiliar, the iterative act of navigating, of finding ways around, acts to coheres a framework of reference points which constitute the field of encounter. While visitors may choose a given path through negative-spaces.github.io, those unafraid of becoming lost are encouraged to explore my research-creation by dérive. The space invites visitors to drift amongst fieldnotes, theory, and geopoetics without destination or need to comprehend everything, allowing room to follow curiosity, to be grasped and lured forward, gleaning in the process. I conclude this section by addressing why I chose GitHub as my platform, and its significance to committing process-oriented scholarship that is accessible and engaging to people outside the academy. I will also record audio for all text portions for those, like myself, who sometimes prefer to learn by listening.

    Why do I locate my work in negative space? I conclude by explaining the meaning of my web address. In visual art, negative space refers to that which surrounds the subject––space whose very existence is necessary in order to give definition to the subject but which is not the intended focus of attention. On a navigational map, if roads are the subject then alleyways are negative space. In research rendered by a linear text.pdf, process is relegated to negative space. Deep mapping attends to spatial anthropology, described by Les Roberts as an “open-ended and radically contingent understanding of space as lived, performed and practiced from strategic vantage points” (2018, 1). To produce an account of my research without s/c/iting the body and my positionality (physically and theoretically) would contribute no more than a superficial reflection of place analogous to a screenshot of Google Maps traced and shaded in Adobe Illustrator. If the act of measurement necessarily impacts that which it measures (Barad 2007), then an acknowledgement of the situated relationality of researcher and interlocutors (human and more-than) is needed. My aim with negative-spaces.github.io is to re-focus attention from within the field, valorizing entangled/practical/embodied ways of engaging with place, producing geographic knowledge, and rendering spatial research. Both form and content enact a radical geohumanities by taking “aim at the practices and processes of knowledge production” (Hawkins et al. 2015, 217). The spatial praxis and digital bricolage which bring negative-spaces.github.io into being serve to extend research-creation into geography and critical cartography. My ultimate praxis as bricoleur-as-researcher, however, is to “challeng[e] practice/theory divides as they police what gets to count as a valid object and method, within which disciplinary framework, where, when, and how” (Loveless 2019, 70).
