    "Place impels me; it is the actor. Place unfurls around me; it becomes the subject." Maleea Acker in Lyric Geography (2019, 132)

Some grey day last winter I walked the stretch of shoreline that wraps around the traditional, ancestral, unceded territory of the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam) First Nations. I am here because from where the sand turns dry begins the land occupied by the University of British Columbia. With the Salish sea on one side and a forest of evergreens and sword ferns to the other, the university at which I am a graduate student is geographically and administratively separated from the city of Vancouver. The beach is the only spot on campus I can breathe easily, where I can think. A five minute walk from the Geography Department takes me to a zig-zag staircase at the bottom of which awaits a place where clothing is optional. My shoes and socks are the first to come off. The sand is cold and firm, yet porous. It holds the impression of my soles and reshapes in my hands. I contain it for a moment - appreciating the texture worn from time and force - then release it. How freeing to exist in a landscape with nothing (on) but the body. 
   
Sunshine was a precious thing my first winter settled in Vancouver when it rained for four months straight. The cloud cover was so dense that a dimple of white was the only indication our star remained. Monochrome days used to really kill my vibe. There’s a dullness to a landscape lit ambiently, a non-differentiation that makes it difficult to articulate thoughts. That day I paused at ocean’s edge where barnacles encrust the rocks and molluscs cling together in crunchy bundles. In and out rolled the waves, and I breathed with them. On each exhale I noticed how foam gathered around the rocks at my feet, forming bubbles on whose surface spun psychedelic spirals. This happens due to thin film interference, where light waves reflecting off the surface of a bubble are interfered with by waves which have been transmitted through the film, reflected back, and refracted at the surface at the angle of incidence. When refracted waves are shifted so as to be in-synch with those reflected, they interfere constructively to make visible an abundance of colors. [sketch reference diagram] 

Deep mapping is constructive interference with the superficial reflection that is place rendered (down) by flat maps. Deep mapping is not constitutive of a map itself but rather a practice of situated, embodied inhabitation. Mapping deeply requires the researcher to enter into dialogue with the field of inquiry. Off the page. In the everyday. 

The importance of place is no secret to geographers, but of those whom I’ve met, few consider their everyday navigations as fieldwork. Riding the bus, walking the bridge, drawing with chalk on the sidewalk – engagements such as these form the origin from where I write. For me, the field is not a site separate from the desk at which geography is written. Thinking with the geographical and conceptual fields of my encounter, I theorize negative spaces of navigational maps––those places, practices, and processes which are necessary for navigation but are not emphasized (left off?) as sites of knowledge production. ?? not quite it
    --> erased like traces of footsteps -- im not going to render but rather theorize from my practice

Deep mapping attends to spatial anthropology, an attempt by Les Roberts' (2018) to name

    "the processes whereby the fundamental spatiality of being is woven into and from everyday practices, dispositions and experiential knowledge. To proceed on these terms ... is to understand and practice space as an existential ground of everyday being." ( 30)

Cultivating a practice of deep mapping is really my way of investigating the "fundamental spatiality of being" for myself. What does being a geographer mean to me? I asked myself to find out while doing my masters. 

experiential knowledge, pratice based research, --> 

making space for deep mapping, rendering

    "research-creation suggests a mode of knowledge production that does more than simply contribute to existing realms of interdisciplinary and disciplinary data. Instead, without eschewing the asymmetries of hierarchical disciplinary differences, it tumbles outside of these intellectual frameworks, challenging practice/theory divides as they police what gets to count as a valid object and method, within which disciplinary framework, where, when, and how." (Loveless 2019, 70)

    “GeoHumanities…do not just require us to move beyond disciplinary silos; they also unsettle relations among theory, praxis, scholarship, practice, and application and undo the privilege of academic expertise. 

 … what might GeoHumanities do, and what might it mean to do the GeoHumanities? …radical because what is developed in the course of such work is not just new knowledge, but a set of reflections that take aim at the practices and processes of knowledge production themselves” (Hawkins et al) NOT SET OF REFLECTIONS BUT INTERVENING THROUGH ENACTING AND RENDERING KNOWLEDGE PRODUCTION AND RESEARCH OTHERWISE

//REFERENCE DIFFRACTION //
reference transformation --> of waves, of self and field --> de certeau quote on aurthor as well

My work responds to the charge for praxis to extend beyond study and actually enact knowledge production differently 

informal economies, gleaning 

From my iteration through theory and practice and by thinking with the (conceptual, geographical, institutional) fields of my encounter, I evolve my own interpretation of deep mapping that serves for now, for this project:    

    Deep mapping is a praxis of iterative intervention with flat maps, established forms of knowledge production, and accepted ways of rendering research public. 

My thesis is a geography in/of/as/through practice. Meaning (it) unfurls around me as I make my way through it. Two texts lure me on: Invisible Cities by Italo Calvino and Rhythmanalysis by Henri Lefebvre. --> many stories from here - rhythmanalysis ---> feel the city from here <---> CONNECTION is being grasped (loveless quote and lefebvre quote)

                    "...to grasp a rhythm it is necessary to have been grasped by it; one must let oneself go, give oneself over, abandon oneself to its duration. 

                The research question is "setting up a dialogue with the world, and driven by the
            very real pulsations of our links+/objets a.16 If we understand research-creation as productive of undutiful, uncanny, boundary objects, it is the queer and queering, polydisciplinamorous link+/objet a that organizes such production. It does so by insisting we attend to those drives and desires that animate our stories—the stories that we find ourselves told by—and the ethics embedded in such modes of attention. The stories at stake here are not conscious. These aren’t simply stories that we mobilize, that we control. These are stories that grasp us as much if not more than we grasp them."

My aim through/out this endeavor and as a cartographer, deep mapper, rhythmanalyst, and bricoleur-as-researcher (not in any particular order) is to valorize process and be open - open to spontaneity, serendipity, and the possibility of being transformed by the field. 

In dedication to the bridge I fell for. You have helped me see and feel.
