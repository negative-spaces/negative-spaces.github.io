        <div id="scroll-text">My first view of Vancouver. The morning after I arrived, August 7th, I walked from 30th
            all the way down to the shore. I knew nothing of this place before coming here. I'd googled pictures of the
            city once back when I was deciding which offer to
            accept<!--I could do a computational focused MSc. in San Diego, an professional program for cartography in the Twin Cities, a Geographic Information Science PhD in Texas, and a master's of applied geography in New Mexico.-->Each
            path led, in my mind, to a divergent trajectory. Who was I going to become? The pandemic began during the
            spring of my sophomore year of undergrad. Within 2 weeks my life radically altered and I decided to graduate
            the next year and go somewhere new. I spent a year isolated in rural Maine. It was there that I began
            walking in the woods, practicing something I called <a
                href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/4ab243f6d7b3490bbfa884d18a788236">isolation
                psychogeography</a>. Under the mentorship of my Intro to GIS teacher, the best teacher I've ever known,
            I explored critical and creative cartographies for my honors thesis. My undergraduate studies were in
            physical geography and geographic information science. I chose geography because, as seems to be common
            among geography undergrads in the states, I had an exceptional AP Human Geography teacher in UBC was the
            only MA program I applied to and though my final decision was on impulse, I think I felt the lure of
            openness to define my own project according to a mix of interests. And mentorship by someone who's skills
            and knowledge spanned a breadth of fields. Looking back on my research statement submitted this time two
            years ago (January 2021), my general aim remains the same:
            <br><br>
            <span class="quote" style="margin-left: 15%; margin-right:8%">
                I am a renaissance student whose skills in the arts and sciences unite in Geographic Information
                Science. My research interests lie in GeoVisualization, Critical Cartography, and the Geohumanities. I
                value both qualitative and quantitative methodologies, and am especially drawn to the ways both
                practices supplement each other. The research streams Digital Geographies, Geospatial Analysis, GIS and
                Knowledge, Ideas, Practices are both of interest to me for I seek the technical skills to map
                transdisciplinary patterns, not just conceptualize them. While my undergraduate background is in the
                physical sciences, I am fundamentally a creative whose passion lies with critical examinations of
                people, their interaction with each other, and response to the natural and built environment.</span>
            <br>
            i've inhabited this place for a year and a half now. i drove to vancouver from the other side of the
            continent via somewhere in the middle of the united states. for the first time in my life i left a familiar
            place without a plan. i had no map save a Rand McNally Atlas of U.S. Road Atlas which i am embarrassed to
            say i forsook in favor of googles maps. even then, however, my journey unfolded in ways i never could have
            imagined and so slowly, i became comfortable with being uncomfortable. with not knowing what lies ahead. so
            much can happen between departure and destination. yet when the goal of a journey is the destination alone,
            getting lost is experienced as an inconvenience. therefore, maps are used to plot a path from A to B,
            departure to destination. with digital maps such as google maps, GPS will geolocate you in cartesian space
            so long as you remain in range of satellite reception. follow the directions spoken in synthesized sentences
            and you won't ever have to feel disoriented. you can't get lost. [recalculating...] you can't get lost

            <br>
            <br>
            my journey to vancouver, into graduate school, and through this project until now has been a process of
            disoriented discovery. everything between departure and destination shapes where you end up. because deep
            mapping is process oriented research, so much of what went into articulating the negative spaces assembled
            above risks being relegated itself to negative space.to intentionally disorient oneself, to get lost as
            method, to slow down, to be guided by serendipity, to follow non-linear trajectories, to start something and
            start over. and over. and over and then claim that all this not only informs that which has coalesced as
            creative output but actually constitutes the research product is my commitment.

            <p>I lived in Dunbar for 7 months after I moved to vancouver. Dunbar is a neighborhood farthest west,
                separated from campus only by Pacific Spirit Park. To commute into the department my housemate and I
                would bike a few blocks to the park then through the woods until we came out at campus luxury
                residences. We'd ride the road, rounding two rotaries, then up one last slope to the main mall. Waving
                goodbye we'd coast the final way to our respective buildings. Where you live in the city matters for how
                you view it. It was a wealthy area of single families and dream homes with no architectural consistency.
                I lived in a tiny house from the 1920s with blackberries in the front and garden beds in the back. Five
                other people lived there, one which made it hell. Dunbar was far from downtown but close to the quieter
                beaches so I began going there after classes instead of home.

            Two months after I arrived in vancouver I began classes and TAing the undergraduate cartography course.
            My role as TA involved facilitating 3 lab sessions a week during which I'd introduce the assignment,
            demonstrate the use of Adobe Illustrator and ArcGIS, and troubleshoot questions. I also marked all 60
            students' weekly lab submissions, the majority of which were maps. The first lab assignment was to make
            a map of downtown Vancouver by tracing a screenshot from google maps. The rubric required land and water
            be differentiated by contour and color, a few 'well known' streets, and 5 points of interest which were
            given. The resulting map no practical use beyond an image. A tourist could not use it for navigation
            without referring to google maps. Which made me wonder whether these maps of the city reflected
            students' lived experience? And if not, what did they render? Or, rather, render invisible?

            I, like many colleagues and undergraduate students, had just moved here. Overwhelm dealing with
            household drama and academic demoralization it took me 6 months before I ventured downtown. I marked 60
            maps of a place I'd never been. They were arrangements of points, lines, and polygons for which I had no
            contextual mental map. By my third term TAing the class I'd walked nearly every street downtown. Before
            the first lab I invited students to spend 5 minutes sketching their mental map of vancouver. Nearly all
            were attempts at reproducing a memorized aerial contour. Areas of inhabitation or commute were more
            articulated/detailed. I think this is important somehow - the practice of connecting (with) your mental
            map before abstracting a place you know from on-the-ground navigation. It helps reveal what flat maps
            relegate to negative space. The required points of attraction I still haven't been to - and probably
            never will. They aren't what interest me.

            My first excursion downtown I took the 7 from Dunbar all the way to the waterfront. I was stuck on a
            term paper and figured disorientation might help. It did. I got off the bus somewhere by the shipyard
            and found a bridge (an infra/structure which has supported me since then). The following became the
            Prologue to that term paper:<br><br>
            <span style="float: left; margin-left:10%">
                Where Main Street ends, at the boundary between Gastown and the Downtown Eastside, there is a
                bridge. Well it’s more of a ramp really that curls around so the road never ends but continues by a
                different name in a new direction. I found myself there the other morning, standing alone just
                gazing towards the North Shore Mountains. It was clear and cold and snow had settled over their
                jagged peaks in a perfect gradient. Before the mountains and directly below me spread a panoply of
                infrastructure––Vancouver’s Centennial Terminals. Tower cranes, gantry cranes, straddle carriers,
                forklifts, trucks, trains, train tracks, shipping containers, and pipes of iron and steel. Every
                dimension was in motion. Machinery moved slowly and methodically while humans moved in erratic
                zig-zags around the pavement. Some were operating the machinery while some machinery were operating
                themselves. As a train drew in below me I peered down to see the conductor watching the switchboard,
                prepared to take action in the event of system failure. But what happens when the train is your
                argument and it fails to budge along the tracks you’ve set out for it to follow? In my case, I laid
                down too many tracks. I got so swept up in constructing the possible paths this essay could take
                that when I geared up to leave the station––to write it all out––I was paralyzed by the tangle
                before me. Although a lifelong creative, my undergraduate background is predominantly in the
                sciences and so thinking and writing academically within the context of humanities scholarship is
                new. The infrastructure of a bridge holds sound because it is built not from one side over to the
                other but from both sides at once. I want to act as a bridge between the arts and sciences and so I
                have thrown myself from mountains, from geomorphology and erosion rates, over to a new shore (and
                country) with cities and people and infrastructures to start building from another perspective.
                Since arrival, I have been all around disoriented and not at all adept. My ideas are sprawling and
                interconnected like Centerm shipyard. There is so much this city this class and these books have led
                me to unpack and explore. For now, however, I am taking one final title, turning in one final
                direction, and following a single train of thought to an end with the idea of infrastructure in
                mind.

            Early April 2022, my friend and I are walking along a familiar street and see, resting amongst the
            regular fairy
            pebbles and kitsch that decorate the bases of so many chestnut trees in this neighborhood, a
            box of chalk.
            It’s an open-ended invitation to which we respond by pausing to draw colorful forms on the
            sidewalk. “Very
            affirming” comments a passerby as they smile and skirt around us. In this moment, we have
            transformed an
            otherwise pedestrian space into a place of interest, using what mediums surround us to
            engage with the city

            I began thinking of my spatial practices and musings as thesis-viable research in spring of 2022. In
            preparation for Spring Review - the first check-in meeting with my thesis supervisory committee - I turned
            out my filing droors to see what material I was working with. From there I spatially categorized my
            literature by topics like "methods/tactics/bricolage" and "theory/framework/backbone" and "cartography." Was
            there even a project there? What did this all add up to? I wrote a 1 page project proposal: <br><br>
            <p id="quote" style="margin-right:5%">
                Before you read my proposal I ask that you take three minutes to sketch a map of your Vancouver. Not
                everywhere or everything. Just the city as you know it. Sense it. Inhabit it. Forget geographical
                accuracy; no projection of is without distortion anyway.
                <br><br>
                What you have made is a counter-cartography. Counter-cartography describes maps and mapping practices
                that counter established ways of rendering and moving through space. For my master’s thesis in geography
                I will create a counter-cartography of Vancouver based on my praxis of deep mapping.
                <br><br>
                To map deeply is to engage with space in an embodied manner, collecting observations with senses beyond
                the visual. I draw theoretical and practical inspiration from psychogeographer Guy Debord, whose map The
                Naked City<sup>1</sup> reconfigurers a map of Paris neighbourhoods based on the directions and
                intensities with which Debord found himself drawn as he walked, or, more precisely, performed
                dérive––drifting. Psychogeography is a mode of deep mapping that attends to the ways in which urban
                geographies effect human emotions and behaviour.<sup>2</sup> My own reconfiguration of Vancouver will
                emerge not only from my observations of the city, but from an attention to reflexivity throughout my
                research process. I find inspiration for an alternate scope in Everything Sings, a narrative atlas by
                Denis Wood of his home neighbourhood. Deep mapping requires from me, the bricoleur-as-researcher, a
                methodological eclecticism.<sup>3</sup> This means gathering/developing a set of methods, skills, and
                materials which I can apply in different configurations based on the situation at hand. I’ve written
                briefly about my toolkit <a href="https://lilydemet.github.io/toolkit.html">here.</a> I will flush this
                out before I ‘begin.’
                <br><br>
                While the form of my counter-cartography, its scope and its purpose are still inchoate, my overarching
                goal for this degree is to explore where I am and figure out what being a geographer is for me. I see my
                thesis as an opportunity to dig in to the ground where I stand––to attune myself to the rhythms of this
                city (including its layers of displacement and erasure) and render something of my own experience here.
                <br><br>
                My thesis is practice-based in that I aim to generate new knowledge by means of a creative practice.
                Moreover, because an understanding of the context and significance of practice-based research claims
                requires direct reference to the original creative work,<sup>4</sup> I invoke research creation to
                support my thesis being a map––a map along with, though not superseded by or interchangeable with, a
                textual component.

            I begin writing for my thesis in a place I come to often - usually late in the morning with
            a smoke and a
            couple hours uninterrupted thinking behind me. From where I stand now I see at once the
            hazy outline of mountains above downtown's quiet skyscrapers, the subway construction at
            Broadway & Cambie
            that exposes the guts of the city while slowing traffic and reconfiguring pedestrian flows,
            and, directly below
            me, people walking rolling and riding about their day.<br><br>

            I like places that offer me perspective, like this spot, or the rooftop parkade of the
            supermarket two blocks
            from here or Granville Bridge. Places above the ground offer an alternate framing of what
            goes on <i>in</i> the city
            - the field in which I practice deep mapping. The sensorium is less overwhelming up here.
            Less abrasive. Bodily
            distanced, I feel less. Vertically distanced, I see more. The places I have Been fall into
            some geospatial
            context. (The surest method of developing spatial awareness, however, is getting lost on the
            ground.) From such
            a vantage, the city and my thesis are more
            easily theorized. I'll take out my notebook or my voice recorder and let the ideas flow.
            <i>Later I'll write
                these up and push them to FIELD_NOTES. I say.</i> Today is the first time I write in
            this place in this place. (Well, I just moved a few feet to a
            stone bench to let a skater boy eat his dinner sitting perched on the very edge. I have
            stood there for 2 hours
            after all. He's playing Bad Bunny which isn't this entry's mood so I'll wrap up this entry
            for today.) Tl;dr:
            Ive written here so many times but with nothing to show (you). Today I write directly on my
            laptop as
            the sun sets against a thousand windows and the chill of a second fall has me wondering
            where all the time
            went.<br><br>

            The city is hazy and so am I. I wake up late, spend till noon fighting the residual stupor of sleeping
            pills. Insomnia comes in waves; I pray it ebbs. I do five things at once without thinking: I wash the
            dishes while
            putting away glasses. I drop them all, I sweep them up and the faucet is still running. I try to eat. I
            choke. I'm unable to swallow like my body is rejecting input. I'm out of breath. My senses dulled. I'm
            lost in
            familiar places. I wander around listening to <i>You want it darker</i> on repeat. The mountains have
            disappeared and even downtown is fading away. I think I've opened myself so wide to feeling this city
            that when it's hazy so
            am I.

            I take the 33 bus to campus on a whim. I'm running late to teach and I don't want to deal with the
            hassle of
            Broadway construction. Why have I never taken the 33? I wonder as a 5 minute walk brings me to a
            deserted
            stop. I sit on a bench in the sun to catch my breath a moment. The 33 is one of the smaller buses.
            Its seats
            have that soft fabric patterned like a roller rink carpet. Riding the 33 is outside my routine. Its
            route
            takes me through places I've been before but have yet to connect via this navigation. ("I didn't
            realize the
            WISE was so close to Commercial! I came a different way last time. Oh, I remember walking through
            this park
            though! Okay, now I know where I am and where the WISE 'really is.'") The city is daily reinvented
            in my
            imaginary. Though far from Venice, I could fill a book with each page a different Vancouver. The
            city
            emerges for me not through place making alone but from connections - spatial relationships - drawn
            by my
            moving in/out/through/between/among areas of familiarity.
            <br><br>
            Navigations articulate a mental map of place. And, though forever evolving and contingent, as the
            field
            becomes more densely networked with/through unique connections, specific areas or spots become more
            anchored
            in relation to one another. In this way, navigation makes navigable. (I can trace in my mind at
            least10
            pathways to travel from where I stand to Centerm Shipyard. And that's as a human – the urban field
            to a crow
            or a pair of chasing squirrels is another.) For me, spatial awareness of the place I inhabit - that
            geographical field of my encounter - develops through embodied spatial practices (see tactics.txt)
            including
            everyday navigations.
            <br><br>
            Later in the day I'm sitting outside with the same book, writing these musings from the _margins_ to
            html. A
            stranger approaches me and asks me, says I'm the only person he's seen today using a physical book.
            We get
            to talking. He's in his eighties, never travelled, says he talks instead to all sorts of people to
            build an
            understanding of the wider world. He offers me advice: something about detours being an important
            part of
            the journey.
            <br><br>
            Taking the 33 instead of the 99 B-Line to campus was a detour from my habitual route. I'd never
            taken the 33
            before but it goes to show spontaneity (in my practical experience) is often met with serendipitous
            convergences.

            Nothing is where I left it. I get up for a walk or eat or rest and when I return the words are there but I've forgotten what they meant. Is my thesis just writing about writing a thesis? Or doing fieldwork? I know I thought it all meant something yesterday. I felt it, at least. I had six ideas before noon and but then I read the last chapter of this book and now I'm not so sure what matters. Is it all very simple and elegantly connected from the start? Or is it a tangled snarl of threads which no amount of good writing can unravel. Topology shifts with something so simple as a bikeride along an unfamilliar route. The city and my framework rearranges ever so slightly, coheres, connects back to something last visited a year ago. My working memory can hold no more than four things at a time which makes writing a thesis where everything is connected and also layered and happening all at once very challenging. I don't think one sentence at a time. I feel ideas and their connections, wake up with words in my mouth, and then iterate through phrasings until I land on an arrangement of words and punctuation that best approximates the feeling. And then I write around this grain until a pearl of something is said. I'm trying to practice writing around nothing (yet) - not waiting for the grains to start writing but just saying whatever's on my mind when I feel stuck and seeing if it goes anywhere. It's all the field - all part of the process of it.
