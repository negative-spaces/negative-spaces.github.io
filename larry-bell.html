        What does it mean to think with place? To feel the city? My research is a praxis-based investigation into how the city is constituted as a field of encounter through everyday navigations. It explores how deep mapping––a practice of situated, embodied inhabitation––generates practical knowledge of an urban geography. Thinking together/with the material-geographical and neural-conceptual fields of my encounter, I theorize deep mapping as constructive interference with flat maps, established forms of knowledge production, and institutionally  accepted ways of rendering academic research.

        Deep mapping bridges theory and practice by assuming the city as interlocutor. My work is research-creation for my questions are driven by intellectual and spatial topoi which grasp and lure me forwards even before I comprehend where they lead; by asking my research questions how I do, I am “setting up a dialogue with the world” (Loveless 2019, 95). So grasped am I by the city’s rhythms I become Lefebvre’s rhythmanalyst (2013). Pressing my chest against the Granville Bridge, I feel at once its trembling vibration and my own heart’s rapid beating. My body in visceral contact with that of the city––its infrastructure––I embody for some duration the city’s rhythm. My concept of deep mapping as constructive interference came to me while breathing with the ocean. The day was grey, but my feet I noticed foam forming bubbles on whose surface spun psychedelic spirals. This happens due to thin film interference, where light waves reflecting off the surface are interfered with by waves which have entered the film and re-emerged as refracted light. When refracted waves align with those reflected, they interfere constructively, intensifying the wavelength of light to make visible an abundance of colors. Deep mapping is constructive interference with the superficial reflection that is place rendered down from above by flat maps. Deep mapping does not counter cartography; it is not defined by opposition so much as through acts of iterative intervention. It is thus a diffractive methodology (Barad 2007), a practice “that elude[s] discipline without being outside the field in which it is exercised” (de Certeau 1984, 98). My research valorizes ways of being and operating in the world (and academy) which cartesian cartography––a manifestation of “the (voracious) property that the geographical system has of being able to transform action into legibility” (de Certeau 1984, 97)––relegates to negative space, to other than the intelligible subject, to outside the field.

        I am building  negative-spaces.github.io as a digital space wherein to convey my knowledge produced through deep mapping without forcing legibility on practice by attempting to operationalize it. My output takes a creative form resembling the rhizomatic process of research-creation and the interconnectedness of my points of reference. In both research and creation I employ tactics of bricolage––the poetics of making do with what tools, skills, and materials are around (Roberts 2018). Tactics are methods whose validity is measured by their applicability to the situation at hand (de Certeau 1984). Practical knowledge. For instance, instead of learning everything about coding and styling webpages before building my website, I teach myself what I need as I go, often gleaning (copypasting) snippets of code (as is custom) that are relevant to what I am attempting in the moment. Indeed, it is through my job at the library––assisting in geospatial information and technology––that I learned to command the version control software I write with (git), and internet hosting service which renders visible my work (GitHub).

        Deep mapping is an exercise in slow scholarship: it takes time to know a place, to follow curiosity, to become lost. Therefore, the bulk of my requested budget is to compensate for the time it takes to do deep mapping during which term I am not TAing. The estimated cost for two months, where 1 day a week is fieldwork, comes to $33.8/hr x 8hrs x 8weeks = $2163.20. As my disability impacts my capacity to read and retain digital information, I am also requesting $300 to cover the cost of books and printer ink cartridges. The rest I glean for and make do.
