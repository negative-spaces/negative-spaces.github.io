    Vancouver is a settler colonial city occupying the unceded and ancestral territory of the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam), Sḵwx̱wú7mesh (Squamish), and səlilwətaɬ (Tsleil-Waututh) Nations. Urban development since the 1800s has reshaped the contours of land and water, filling in much of the local tidal flat and paving over many streams. Today, streets and alleyways extend like asphalt riverbeds along whose shorelines the excess of human consumption accumulates for disposal. Discarded matters evince spectacular abundances. Crows feast on overflowing human remains. Garbage is composition awaiting compaction.

Spilling from torn bags, various containers and food waste litter the asphalt as crows perch amid the detritus.

        Not only municipal waste defies containment. Residential curbs mark porous boundaries of property where belonging is in flux. Operating on urban denizens’ tacit knowledge of the city, matters deemed no longer fit for manufactured purpose are offered up as open-ended invitations for recirculation by passersby. Half my wardrobe I gleaned from cardboard boxes left on the sidewalk or by back-alley dumpsters, pinned to trees or tossed over fences. A fleece vest, vintage dress, quarter zip, jeans, sweatpants, and sneakers to name but a few. Items found whilst walking the city now collaborators in my everyday research and writing practices include a coffee  mug, backpack, stapler, desk, and Epson WorkForce Pro 4740 printer found with a note reading: I STILL WORK.

        The decadence of disposal is ripe with contamination. Graffiti transforms commercial dumpsters, newspaper boxes, utility boxes, street signs, and the sides of vacant storefronts into sites of discordant discourses. I follow their drift across the city (see <a href="./rhythmanalysis.html" target="_blank">negative-spaces/rhythmanalysis.html</a>). On a walk to the grocers last month as I was contemplating how to narrate this page when I encountered something new: An Economy Is A Soul/Spirit/Love.

        Urban shorelines prove sites of leaky disposal where use and value are rendered differently intelligible by human and more-than-human scavengers. Like the crows, I poach matter and meaning from what I find around, performing bricolage with the physical-conceptual field of my encounter. (Sometimes I don't take anything more than what I need in the moment: a chair to sit in while on a therapy call; an electrical socket to plug my phone in so it doesn't die during my therapy call.) How do unruly material and semiotic flows interfere with regulated forms of exchange from within the dominate system? With this page, I describe my tactics of practice and how they interfere with hegemonic economies of knowledge production in ways that matter. My reference to hegemonic economies of knowledge production is specific to the formal requirements of institutional publishing which render research outputs legible as objects of knowledge, and, the boundary making practices by which field and researcher are made differentially articulate. In <a href="./rendering.html" target="_blank">negative-spaces/rendering.html, </a>I further elaborate how both my interference practice and the effects of my interference practice at once articulate and refigure such boundaries.

      Write Murris and Bozalek (2019): "A diffractive methodology contests the notion that a researcher can be taught tools or techniques about a world which is independent of and at an ontological distance from the researcher." As discussed in <a href="./interference.html" target="_blank">negative-spaces/interference.html, </a>field and researcher (including instruments of investigation) are provisional configurations whose intelligibility within and as part of specific phenomena is the effect of iterative 'intra-actions' (Barad 2007). In other words, 'agential separability' (Barad 2007) is the condition of exteriority-within-phenomena whereby field and researcher (including instruments of investigation) become differentially articulated. The field itself might be better understood as a phenomena wherein which field<i>site</i> becomes intelligible as a bounded area/extent/scope in dynamic relation to the framing of a researcher and their instruments of investigation. For example, by siting the graffiti of an economy on my phones camera I cropped all geographic context out of sight. By embedding the image here as reference I privilege the visual, the transmission of meaning made possible by numerous technologies and operations entirely elided from the scene. A site, as part of the world rendered provisionally determinate, is itself a phenomenon within which empirical formations like 'data' become differentially intelligible. Sites change. Data moves. Alleyways are refigured. A pair of sneakers moves from the fence post to the lid of a neighboring recycle bin. A metal chair with cerulean upholstery migrates down an alleyway before winding up in someone's garage. I take an espresso maker found on the road verge back to my house where it sits under the stairs, in my room, in my car, until months later a friend uses it and I feel like I can let it go in the alley again. Hours later it's gone.

        Because the boundary between agencies of observation (instruments and researcher, whose 'human-ness' is itself the effect of boundary making practices) and object of observation is re/figured within the phenomenon of every encounter, "the researcher-as-bricoleur" is "equipped with a set of tools rather than a fit-for-purpose methodological strategy" (Roberts 2018a, 54). Deep mapping therefore employs tactics. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Tactics are methods whose validity is measured by their applicability to the situation at hand (Roberts 2018b). In <i>The Practice of Everyday Life</i> (1984), Michel de Certeau describes everyday practices such as talking, reading, and moving about as tactical, "ways of operating" the Greeks called mētis (xix). De Certeau describe the tactics of everyday practices as opportunistic; appropriating the hegemonic system from within, such "surreptitious creativities" form a "proliferating illegitimacy" which resists the authority that seeks their administration or suppression (1984, 96). Tactics poach the dominate system from within while eluding discipline. James Scott (1998) elaborates mētis as practical knowledge. In contrast with epistemologies that are abstract, general, and universal, practical knowledge is experiential, situated, and local (Scott 1998). Tactics deploy practical knowledge.

      For example, over the summer a friend asked if I would print my artwork on a tote bag. Looking into numerous custom printing websites, it seemed that with the complexity of my designs and color palette, a single bag would cost me over fifty dollars. Unsure what to do, I then remembered seeing blank canvas tote bags for sale at a nearby crafts store. I also remembered that as a kid, my baba had helped me print my drawings of dinosaurs onto transfer paper which I'd then ironed onto T-shirts. I thought, why not print my own tote bags? I soon began experimenting with clothing, printing on T-shirts that were gifted to me or, in most cases, clothing I scavenged from the fabric recycling dumpster in the basement of my building.

    I printed my designs using the printer I gleaned from the alleyway, and appropriated part of a research grant to buy transfer paper and printer ink. Being ADHD, I require hard copies of texts to read; my printer is therefore not an indulgent accessory but interlocutor in my knowledge production. With my Arts Graduate Research Award I bought yarn and crochet hooks because handwork helps me regulate my emotions and also focus while attending lectures. I made a blanket and have begun my second vest. While I gleaned patterns from Youtube, I learned knitting and crocheting through Waldorf education. These crafting capers and may seem like unrelated hobbies and expenditures, but for me, they help me modulate my attention so that I can think, write, and show up in all the ways required of me by my program. In this sense, I invoke the creative humanities by "making as/through thinking and thinking as/through making" (van der Tuin and Verhoeff 2022, 2) in diverse yet interconnected manners.

    In both field research and website creation, I employ spatial bricolage––the poetics of ‘making do’ with what tools, skills, and materials are readily available (Roberts 2018b). I take and make do with what has been disposed of, discarded, and/or freely given. I appropriate tools, skills, and resources garnered through formal means for alternate purposes. Gleaning is the related practice of gathering information or materials from one's surroundings. Les Roberts refers to "gleaning as a spatial praxis" (Roberts 2018a, 57). Elsewhere, he writes,
    <br>
    <span class="quote">
      Whatever is found in whatever landscape the gleaner-bricoleur happens to find herself at whatever time she happens to be there is potentially constituent matter of an assemblage-in-progress, the production of which may take a number of different forms (or none at all - the practice of gleaning-bricolage need not cede an 'output' for it to still count as gleaning and/or bricolage).

    Once deciding on building a website, instead of learning everything about coding and styling webpages before beginning I teach myself what I need as I go, often gleaning (copypasting) snippets of open source code (as is custom) that are relevant to what I am attempting in the moment.  Each page of my website is differently designed depending on the type of content I want to display. For instance, <a href="./rhythmanalysis.html" target="_blank">negative-spaces/rhythmanalysis.html </a>contains a multitude of images, so I learned how to make image grids from W3Schools web tutorials ("How To Create an Image Grid" 2023). When constructing the .html documents, I even glean from myself, copypasting fragments of form from one page to perform a similar function on another. 
  </p>

  <p>
    I also glean practical knowledge developed teaching, practicing, and consulting on matters of Cartesian cartography and geographic information systems (GIS). I learned to use git and Github––the version control software and internet hosting platform I use to track my thesis process––through my job at UBC Library where I develop and lead workshops on GIS, as well as provide one on one consultations. In consults, I am often required to troubleshoot technical workflows. This requires not that I know everything beforehand, but that I know <i>how</i> to find information relevant to the question at hand. Whether giving GIS consults, working as a cartography Teaching Assistant, or making reference maps for scholarly publications, I exercise computational thinking. This is a skill I learned through a programming course for GIS I took in undergrad. Computational thinking is a problem solving technique that was taught to me by Forrest Bowlick as follows: decomposition → pattern recognition → abstraction → algorithm. (Abstraction and pattern recognition can be in alternate positions.) The point is to approach a problem by deconstructing it into component parts, recognizing similarities and connections, identifying and representing the gist of what needs to be done, and creating a plan to do it. I use computational thinking in the iterative formation of negative-spaces to tackle tasks like transcribing voice recordings, scanning books, and organizing the physical copies of all my literature. The algorithms, or workflows I’ve developed as needed have become tactics singular to my process of creation.  
  </p>

  <p>
    Much of the labor in writing a page, then, is sifting through the tremendous amounts of data. There are hundreds of audio recordings on an old Olympus voice recorder originally bought in 2009 to record fiddle tunes learned by year each Maine Fiddle Camp. There are over a dozen field note journals and all the notes I take and make directly on books and printed articles. There are thousands of photographs and audiovisuals taken in the past three years only a fraction of which are included in my research-creation output. My thesis, aka negative-spaces, aka this space and its constitutive files, is the effect of spatial and temporal bricolage. It is an assemblage of multimedia made for multiple occasions. Writing from my first winter in the program supplements writing from my third. I hear an audio recording I forgot I made at just the right moment for an idea to take shape. The process of writing each page is one of stitching together writings, photographs, recordings, sketches, and notes across times and contexts. I attend to patterns of resonance as I suture concepts and multimedia together, recognizing that the topology I articulate is one of an infinitely infinite number of possibilities. Often I draw from writing written a year or more ago, or writing written in the name of another project. This page, negative-spaces/tactics.html, is in part constituted by efforts towards three different conference presentations. Writing abstracts relevant to sections of my thesis I have yet to write is a tactic I use to keep me excited and motivated to write my thesis. Through this 'guileful ruse', I generate material I then poach for negative-spaces.

  <p><span style="font-weight:700">WRITING INTERFERENCE, WRITING ECONOMIES</span>
    <br>
    A year and a half ago I sat with a group of economic geographers at Koerner's, a pub five minutes walk from our department. My interlocutor who studies economic geography and the political economy of land asked me if and how I saw myself participating in the economy whilst deep mapping. Never having considered this, I responded, "Not really… well, maybe when I buy something?" "Read Priti and Emily's paper <i>From crisis to the everyday: Shouldn't we all be writing economies?</i>" she told me, "It's everything." 
  </p>

  <p>
    Priti Narayan and Emily Rosenman (2022) unsettle notions of expertise located in the academic, urging a reorientation to writing economic geography that recognizes how "knowledge production about the economy is already embedded in the economy itself… " (393). They problematize <i>how</i> knowledge is made legible as 'economic' within academia. What counts as economic geography is often what is written and cited by established economic geographers, quote, "as if economics is not about how we, we <i>all</i>, live in the everyday"  (Narayan and Rosenman 2022, 399, emphasis in original). Though I am not situated within the subdiscipline of economic geography, as graduate student researcher, I have found myself to be embedded in economies of academic knowledge production. This realization led me to consider why it matters that I intentionally think and write about geographic knowledge production <i>through</i> everyday practices of urban inhabitation, and do so in material and semiotic dialogue with the physical-conceptual field of my encounter. 
  </p>

  <p>
    In conversation with Gilles Deleuze, Michel Foucault notes that the public does not require intellectuals for to gain knowledge; "they [the public, or "masses"] know perfectly well… they are certainly capable of expressing themselves" (Foucault 1977, 207). Intellectuals are agents in a "system of power which blocks, prohibits, and invalidates this discourse and this knowledge"––indeed, the idea that intellectuals are responsible for knowledge and "discourse forms part of the system" (Foucault 1977, 207). Foucault argues the intellectual's role is to struggle against forms of power that elevate academics as experts:
    <br><br>
    <span class="quote">
      In this sense theory does not express, translate, or serve to apply practice: it is practice. But it is local and regional, as you said, and not totalising. This is a struggle against power, a struggle aimed at revealing and undermining power where it is most invisible and insidious… to sap power, to take power; it is an activity conducted alongside those who struggle for power, and not their illumination from a safe distance. A "theory " is the regional system of this struggle. (Foucault 1977, 208)
    </span>
  </p>
  
    <p>
      Note that an equally important form of struggle needed is the active solidarity of systemically privileged and capacitated intellectuals with those marginalized and/or rendered precarious by hegemonies of knowledge production that elevate white, cisheteromasculanist, and anglophone voices. Thinking about how academic knowledge is made legible within a given field leads to the examination of the apparatuses by which a field is constituted/maintained. For example, Helen Meekosha (2011) points out the "universalizing tendencies" (678) of Disability Studies, arguing that the discipline "constitutes a form of scholarly colonialism" (668) and calling for "a global perspective by disability scholars that specifically incorporates the role of the global North in 'disabling' the global South" (668). Colonial occupation's regimes of violence and dispossession which 'debilitate' populations (Puar 2017) influences where, when, how, and under what conditions academic knowledge is produced. Today, I think about Israel's ongoing scholasticide in Palestine (see “F4P, JFN and PCAAN Urge University Presidents To Take Action Opposing Scholasticide In Gaza” 2024) and how many academics will longer get to produce knowledge, how schools and educational buildings have been targeted and archives demolished, how many university students will not get to learn from their teachers or learn at all, the dreams of thousands of children and highschoolers to go forever unrealized. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Responding to Foucault, Deleuze says:<br>
    <span class="quote">
      Precisely. A theory is exactly like a box of tools. It has nothing to do with the signifier. It must be useful. It must function. And not for itself. If no one uses it, beginning with the theoretician himself (who then ceases to be a theoretician), then the theory is worthless or the moment is inappropriate…" (in Foucault 1977, 208)
    </span>
    <br>
    Taken thus, a theory is a tactic of investigation. Appropriately applying a theory requires practice using it in different situations. Like practical knowledge which is experiential, situated, and local (Scott 1998) and the "proliferating illegitimacy" of tactics which elude regulation by the dominate system (de Certeau 1984, 96), "A theory does not totalise; it is an instrument for multiplication and it also multiplies itself" (Deleuze in Foucault 1977, 208). My theorization of deep mapping has value only so long as it is enacted as praxis. It became articulated as it is so as to remain a relevant tactic no matter what situation I found myself in. My theory of deep mapping is practical knowledge. It is constituted as the effect of everyday interferences with hegemonic forms of engaging place, producing geographic knowledge, and rendering spatial research public. I return now to why it matters that I intentionally think and write about geographic knowledge production <i>through</i> everyday practices of urban inhabitation, and do so in material and semiotic dialogue with the physical-conceptual field of my encounter. 
  </p>
<p>
  Drawing from Karen Barad's posthuman performativity (2007) as discussed in <a href="./interference.html" target="_blank">negative-spaces/interference.html, </a>I recognize "Knowing is a distributed practice that includes the larger material arrangement…(i.e., the full set of practices) that is a part of the phenomenon investigated or produced" (379, 390). Remember, my initial research-creation question was: What could it mean to think <i>with</i> place? to <i>feel</i> the city? Before I encountered Barad I had begun to consider citing the city as co-author, an impulse which matured into assuming the field of encounter as interlocutor. If agential realism figures posthuman publics, new ways of referencing thinking <i>with</i> are required. Whom I think with comes to matter through the practices by which I acknowledge intellectual others. Citation is a form of address, a formal acknowledgement of an other within the written conversation of an academic text. Under academic capitalism (see Paasi 2005), high citation counts become not only a metric of success but a precondition of legibility(???). Mott and Cockayne (2017) call for conscientious engagement in citation as a performative practice for resisting "hegemonies of knowledge production and authority" within the neoliberal university that reify white, cisgendered, heteromasculinist narratives (959). In <a href="./rendering.html" target="_blank">negative-spaces/rendering.html, </a>I go further to propose <i>sitation</i> as an alternative boundary drawing practice to citation, one which recognizes encounters as phenomena wherein field and researcher (equipped with tactics of investigation) intra-actively mark one another. Sitation assumes agencies and object of investigation to be provisional configurations where encounter's formal acknowledgement within an academic work renders <i>intra-locutors</i> differentially determinate. Whereas citation cites int<i>er</i>action, sitation sites int<i>ra</i>-action. For me, the field is not a site separate from the desk at which I produce geographic knowledge, the printer with which I render spatial research legible to my eyes, the bridge with whom each traverse brings me nearer to understanding transgression.
</p>

<p>
  Rosenman and Narayan (2022) argue that reimagining the subdiscipline for a 'public economic geography' would entail "serious consideration of authorship, audience, citations, methods, modes and targets of publication…. beyond academic categories and methods employed so far" (401). They are clear that "Praxis cannot be located in simply the study of economy, or in proposing alternatives, but in actually <i>enacting</i> writing and knowledge production differently, bearing in mind its material and political consequences" (Narayan and Rosenman 2022, 400, emphasis in original). I am not arguing that what I do is necessarily public economic geography but rather that if economics is about how we live in the everyday (Narayan and Rosenman 2022), then deep mapping is a performative practice for enacting 'diverse economies' (Gibson-Graham 2008). Or maybe that is precisely the point - that an economy is not limited, as I once believed, to the consumption of goods and services, but about everyday arts of inhabitation. What if an economy <i>were</i> a soul/spirit/love? What might exchange look like then? My deep mapping practice at once interferes with hegemonic economies by poaching skills/materials/resources from the dominate capitalist system, and enacts/forges an alter-economy of knowledge production through siting a posthuman public articulated through distributed thinking. How might the tactics of practical knowledge be employed to interfere with epistemological hegemonies from within the neoliberal university at the graduate level?
