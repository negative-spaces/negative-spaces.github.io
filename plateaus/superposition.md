# Superposition 

>"Research-creation, in important ways, resists the illustrative frameworks in which a thesis or dissertation explains, justifies, or describes an artistic practice (and vice-versa), exploding the inherited binary between the artist-object and the theorist-subject..." (Loveless 2019, 44) Form! Matters!
>"research-creation suggests a mode of knowledge production that does more than simply contribute to existing realms of interdisciplinary and disciplinary data. Instead, without eschewing the asymmetries of hierarchical disciplinary differences, it tumbles outside of these intellectual frameworks, challenging practice/theory divides as they police what gets to count as a valid object and method, within which disciplinary framework, where, when, and how" (Lovless 2019, 70). 

>“GeoHumanities… do not just require us to move beyond disciplinary silos; they also unsettle relations among theory, praxis, scholarship, practice, and application and undo the privilege of academic expertise. …radical because what is developed in the course of such work is not just new knowledge, but a set of reflections that take aim at the practices and processes of knowledge production themselves” (Hawkins et al)

"intelligibility is an ontological performance of the world in its ongoing articulation." (Barad 2007, 149)

After a risky speech I was asked: "Are you more of a wave or a particle?" All I could think to say then was "interesting how you've framed the question as an either or..." 

I've been holding the duality in mind since - subconsciously mostly - until a thought came one morning like the momentary illumination of lighting:

I am (we are all) like beams of light both wave and particle. At times apprehended as nominal individuals with fixed, bounded, and defined bodies, we are all so permeable - transfiguring through encounter (sites of differentiation), continuously becoming (and becoming undone) through the process of intra-action. We emanate waves which interfere and are interfered with by others, human and nonhuman. To practice deep mapping is to embody superposition: (theorypractice, spacetime, waveparticle, subjectobject, thinkingbeing, insideoutside,  .... ). Paradox is not a closure but an opening - to possibilities - the existance of simultaneous multiplicities: many stories, multiple scales, inextricable layers.



its all tactical Luke - what am i gon asay 


-about theorizing through practice thinking through practice - thining with place-relationship, sitauted knwoledges... how throy ocma bout applying theory so far ... thats the physcial conceptual work -- not oopositon again - transgression isnt in side outside negatice space limit changing thats why tactics. site intereferecne aag -- site of in. but calncy realized tactic too

synmposion 
if id shown up seady 
not good agg but did the job at the symposium 
line of legibility expeacations was different
