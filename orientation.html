            Many stories exist within the landscape. What do you see? [An epigraph from the field, words carved into a
            wooden frame that stands at Jericho Beach.] The The field iis beyond whats framed - there, in this thesis.
            but one story, partial, one sided, retelling dialogue and what ive thought with teh field.
            <br><br>
            multiplicity of multiplicities!
            <br><br>
            I want to begin my thesis with an introduction to "the field" - something i began thinking about when I
            first wrote a draft framework but abandoned for lack of words. I will get into "the expanded field" and
            problematising opositions briefly, intelligibility, legibility and negative space too. I'll go deeper into
            the connection to transgression in another page. Maybe i will tell a story of theorizing through practice,
            or save that for elsewhere.
            <br><br>
            Anyways, here i put an abstract to such a story that was rejected from a special issue call for creative
            urban methods, but which I think does a nice job drawing from previous writing to initiate a conversation.

                    <b>Deep Mapping: Thinking with place, feeling the city</b>
                    <br><br>
                    While academic geographers and urban planners may theorize and design city places, urban space is
                    performatively constituted through the everyday spatial practices of inhabitants whose navigations
                    both cultivate and deploy practical, experiential knowledge. Drawing from Barad’s agential realism
                    (Barad 2007), I approach the city as a physical-conceptual field whose emergent topology is
                    continuously reconfiguring through intra-action. Framed thus, the city is not a fixed and inherently
                    bounded object exterior to the researcher. Nor is it a field separate from the site where spatial
                    analyses are produced, maps rendered, and urban geography written. Bringing this orientation to the
                    ground, however, requires a praxis-based methodology for urban research that assumes the field of
                    encounter as interlocutor. I invoke research-creation (Loveless 2019) to initiate such a dialogue
                    with the world, asking
                    <br><br>
                    <i>What could it mean to think with place? to feel the city?</i>
                    <br><br>
                    I explore and respond to these questions through urban deep mapping, a practice of situated,
                    embodied inhabitation by which I enter into dialogue with my surroundings. In what follows, I tell a
                    story of theorizing through practice. I articulate how my theoretical framework forms and transforms
                    in the process of navigating Vancouver. My research-creation is driven by intellectual and spatial
                    topoi which grasp and lure me forwards even before I comprehend where they lead (Loveless 2019, 95).
                    Pressing my chest against the Granville Bridge, I feel at once its trembling vibration and my own
                    heart’s rapid beating. I embody a sonic superposition: vibrational waves overlap; interfere;
                    combine. The rhythm of their resulting wave marks a pattern of interference, referred to in physics
                    as a diffraction pattern. Visceral encounter entangles me with an infrastructure I had heretofore
                    differentiated as an inert other––an instrument whose vantage supported an abstraction and analysis
                    of the city below. I leave the bridge holding a little of my warmth and bring away with me this
                    idea. . .
                    <br><br>
                    Deep mapping does not render down to a flat map. Yet neither does it ‘counter cartography’ (c.f.
                    Mason-Deese 2020). As I theorize it, deep mapping is not defined by opposition so much as through
                    iterative acts of interference with hegemonic forms of engaging/representing place, producing
                    geographic knowledge, and rendering spatial research public. Understood this way, deep mapping is a
                    diffractive apparatus for making interferences and studying how these patterns of difference come to
                    matter (Barad 2007).
                    <br><br>
                    Many stories exist in the landscape. What do you see? The following story is but one interpretation
                    of my ongoing conversation with my city––a response woven with support from diverse literatures read
                    through one another. Much of what I have gleaned remains (as yet) ineffable. And, that which I have
                    theorized evolves from my own situated spatiotemporal practice. Therefore, I do not attempt to
                    define deep mapping so much as possibilize a mode of doing theory grounded in practice. Sharing my
                    story enacts deep mapping as praxis: challenging the boundaries of field and research, I valorize
                    ways of being and operating in the world (de Certeau 1984) and academy that generatively interfere
                    with hegemonic norms of intelligibility and legibility.
