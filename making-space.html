                > How might knowledge generated through spatial praxes be rendered without being flattened, georeferenced, or vectorized? This presentation introduces negative-spaces.github.io, the digital space I am building to convey my master’s research in a form akin to the rhizomatic process of its creation and the interconnectedness of intellectual and spatial topoi which lure me to disoriented discovery. I will demonstrate how my theorization of deep mapping––constituted through my practice of deep mapping––is enacted in both the construction and structure of negative-spaces.github.io. Deep mapping does not counter cartography; it is not defined by opposition so much as through acts of iterative interference. Deep mapping is thus a tactic for transgression. By locating my thesis output in negative space, I aim to refocus attention from within the field to other/ed modes of engaging with place, producing geographic knowledge, and rendering spatial research public.<br>

        "It seems as though in the end, maps––the successful ones, the ones that show us where we are and get us from here to there––risk offering only two alternatives. They let us see too much, and hence blind us to what we cannot see, imposing a quiet <b>tyranny of orientation that erases the possibility of disoriented discovery</b>, or they lose sight of all the other things that we ought to see. They omit, according to their conventions, those invisible lines of people, places, and networks that create the most common spaces we live in today." (Kurgan 2013, 16-17)

        "It is true that the operations of walking on can be traced on city maps in such a way as to transcribe their paths (here well-trodden, there very faint) and their trajectories (going this way and not that). But these thick or thin curves only refer, like words, to the absence of what has passed by. <span style="font-weight:600">Surveys of routes miss what was: the act itself of passing by.</span> The operation of walking, wandering, or "window shopping," that is, the activity of passers-by, is transformed into points that draw a totalizing and reversible line on the map. They allow us to grasp only a relic set in the nowhen of a surface of projection. Itself visible, it has the effect of making invisible the operation that made it possible. These fixations constitute procedures for forgetting. <b>The trace left behind is substituted for the practice.</b> It exhibits the <span style="font-weight:520">(voracious) property that the geographical system has of being able to transform action into legibility, but in doing so it causes a way of being in the world to be forgotten."</span> <a href="#bibliography">(de Certeau 1984, 97)</a>

        <B>making space for deep mapping: theory as praxis</B><br>
        I have come to understand being a geographer as less of an ability to know where you are in space at all times and more of a capacity to learn through disorientation. Like many colleagues, I began graduate school in a place I’d ever been before and where I knew no one. As teaching assistant for a departmental cartography course, I was responsible for introducing and evaluating assignments, as well as demonstrating the use of required software. The first assignment: to make a map of downtown Vancouver by tracing a screenshot from Google Maps in Adobe Illustrator. I graded sixty of these ‘maps’ before finally venturing to the place they represented. Until then, this area of the city did not exist for me because it had no relation within my mental map. Spatial awareness of my surroundings has evolved not by following Google Maps from A to B or memorizing its aerial contours but rather through becoming lost and wandering around.
        <br><br>
        How, then, might knowledge generated through everyday spatial practices be rendered without being flattened, georeferenced, or vectorized? This page introduces <span style="opacity: .6">github.com/negative-spaces/</span>negative-spaces.github.io, the web-field-site I am building to convey my research in a form akin to the rhizomatic process of its creation and the interconnectedness of intellectual and spatial topoi which lure me to disoriented discovery. In what follows, I articulate how my theorization of deep mapping––constituted through my practice of deep mapping––is enacted in both the construction and structure of negative-spaces.github.io. 
        <br><br>
        Deep mapping eludes operationalization in its capaciousness, though becoming lost and wandering around is an excellent state wherein to begin. Mapping deeply lends attention to "the processes whereby the fundamental spatiality of being is woven into and from everyday practices, dispositions and experiential knowledge” (Roberts 2018, 30). For me, deep mapping is a practice of situated, embodied inhabitation through which I enter into dialogue with my surroundings. Thus engaged, I explore how my navigations performatively constitute the city as a physical-conceptual field of encounter. Deep mapping as I have come to theorize with it does not ‘counter cartography’ (cf. Mason-Deese 2020); it is not defined by opposition so much as through iterative acts of interference with hegemonic forms of engaging with and representing place, producing geographic knowledge, and rendering spatial research public. Understood this way, deep mapping is a diffractive apparatus (Barad 2007) whose pattern(s) of interference may be approached as either a tactic and site of knowledge production. Theory as praxis commits both. Thinking through practice, I weave (myself) together (with) the physical and conceptual fields of my encounter, our selves becoming entangled in the continual transformation of this intra-active process.
