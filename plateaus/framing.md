## Frameworks
>"Research-creation, in important ways, resists the illustrative frameworks in which a thesis or dissertation explains, justifies, or describes an artistic practice (and vice-versa), exploding the inherited binary between the artist-object and the theorist-subject..." (Loveless 2019, 44) 
>"research-creation suggests a mode of knowledge production that does more than simply contribute to existing realms of interdisciplinary and disciplinary data. Instead, without eschewing the asymmetries of hierarchical disciplinary differences, it tumbles outside of these intellectual frameworks, challenging practice/theory divides as they police what gets to count as a valid object and method, within which disciplinary framework, where, when, and how" (Lovless 2019, 70). 

My field cannot be instantaneously apprehended as the nominal City, nor can it be captured by the frame of a single map. Neither is one existing disciplinary framework or methodology sufficient: each time I leave home I bring along the people/stories/theories I wish to think with for the day. I put texts into conversation first amongst themselves. Heavy in my bag, their pages interlap, folding together like a pair of hands. Opening one, I open myself: README.md; Transform me. My field is the emergent web of connections drawing together (with) physical and conceptual topoi––a topology continuously transforming through intra-action. It is this relational entanglement that is at stake in rendering thinking through practice. 

## Framing 
cutting, frameing, creates negative space but definintion, bounding important sometimes (like to write a thesis) so i try my best to be accountabiley for constitutive exclusions 

**agental realism** when do i get into this??

“knowing, thinking, measuring, theorizing, and observing are material practices of intra-acting within and as part of the world” (Barad 2007, 90).

Deep mapping is a way of living spatially - being both of the world and accountable for 'intra-acting within and as part of the world in its differential becoming' (barad  2007)

![many-stories](../media/field/jericho-beach.png)
*Many stories exist in the landscape. What do you see?*


Situated Knowledges - Donna Haraway - accountability for positionality, perspective, location, situatedness, partial view.  
**assuming field of encounter as interlocutor** disorients subject-object dualism - agential realism 

Intertextuality 

Conveying **partial** side of conversation, an interpretation. I do not claim to speak for the field nor from the perspective of anyone but myself.

    The following story is but one interpretation of my ongoing conversation with my city––a response woven with support from diverse literatures read through one another. Much of what I have gleaned remains (as yet) ineffable. And, that which I have theorized evolves from my own situated spatiotemporal practice. Therefore, I do not attempt to define deep mapping so much as possibilize a mode of doing theory grounded in practice. Sharing my story enacts deep mapping as praxis: challenging the boundaries of field and research, I valorize ways of being and operating in the world and academy that generatively interfere with hegemonic norms of intelligibility and legibility. 

 
research-creation: "insisting we attend to those drives and desires that animate our stories—the stories that we find ourselves told by—and the ethics embedded in such modes of attention. The stories at stake here are not conscious. These aren’t simply stories that we mobilize, that we control. These are stories that grasp us as much if not more than we grasp them." (Loveless 2019, 95)

For me these stories are Invisible Cities by Italo Calvino and Rhythmanalysis by Henri Lefebvre. "...to grasp a rhythm it is necessary to have been grasped by it; one must let oneself go, give oneself over, abandon oneself to its duration. (Lefebvre. 27) --> Bridge --> good description of boundary practices of frames, why necessary, how made and remade through intra action
