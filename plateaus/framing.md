# framing a story

*Presuppositions elaborated elsewhere to be reiterated here: Field performatively constituted through navigations; city as physical-conceptual field of encounter.*

Introduce Negative space - avoid the subject. expanding field by valorizing negative space - its all the field.  - interfering from within by challenging boundaries of legibility/intelligibility. However, framing/frameworks/bounding is necessary sometimes, like to write a thesis. Introduce agental realism, cuts - constitutive exclusions, Situated knowledges - accountability for negative space. its all the _possible_ field. Multiple stories, what stories/theories/frameworks grasp me? What dont? Where didnt I take things and why? 


## Negative Space 

Vignette: 
    Avoid the subject sticker on lampost in gastown - February 2022 during rhythmanalysis (before i knew of the book) at intersection as part of counter-cartographies

In visual art, negative space is that which surrounds the subject but is not the intended focus of attention. Indeed, the intelligible form is defined by what it others––what it excludes, what it is not. 
For example, alleyways occupy negative space on Google’s street map. 

Krauss constructs the **expanded field** through problematizing oppositions (sculpture as not-landscape and not-architecture). 

I argue for **refocusing the frame - expanding what counts as field**, as as valid research method, output, subject. I locate my work in negative space, rendering negative-spaces.github.io -->  process, margins, refocusing from within the field, boundaries/limits 
>"research-creation suggests a mode of knowledge production that does more than simply contribute to existing realms of interdisciplinary and disciplinary data. Instead, without eschewing the asymmetries of hierarchical disciplinary differences, it tumbles outside of these intellectual frameworks, challenging practice/theory divides as they police what gets to count as a valid object and method, within which disciplinary framework, where, when, and how" (Lovless 2019, 70).

## overlaying frameworks, intertextuality, diffractive reading
 
My field cannot be instantaneously apprehended as the nominal City, nor can it be captured by the frame of a single map. Neither is one existing disciplinary framework or methodology sufficient: each time I leave home I bring along the people/stories/theories I wish to think with for the day. I put texts into conversation first amongst themselves. Heavy in my bag, their pages interlap, folding together like a pair of hands. Opening one, I open myself: README.md; Transform me. My field is the emergent web of connections drawing together (with) physical and conceptual topoi––a topology continuously transforming through intra-action. It is this relational entanglement that is at stake in rendering thinking through practice. 

## Framing 

![many-stories](../media/field/jericho-beach.png)
*Many stories exist in the landscape. What do you see?*
*slightly ironic bc i have exceptional eyesight and have difficulty differentiating foreground and background. so, actually, bounding is very important for me in this thesis bc otherwise i will include every single thing i think of thats relevant.*

cutting, framing, bounding important sometimes (like writing a thesis) - background/foreground, not forclosing other possibilities - accountability for constitutive exclusions  and negative space. --> thats feminist objectivity 

**agental realism** 
“knowing, thinking, measuring, theorizing, and observing are material practices of intra-acting within and as part of the world” (Barad 2007, 90).

**Situated Knowledges** - Donna Haraway - accountability for positionality, perspective, location, situatedness, partial view.  

**assuming field of encounter as interlocutor** disorients representationalist dualisms
 
Conveying **partial** side of conversation, an interpretation. I do not claim to speak for the field nor from the perspective of anyone but myself. What informs this thesis is but one interpretation of my ongoing conversation with my city––a response woven with support from diverse literatures read through one another. Much of what I have gleaned remains (as yet) ineffable. And, that which I have theorized evolves from my own situated spatiotemporal practice. Therefore, I do not attempt to define deep mapping so much as possibilize a mode of doing theory grounded in practice. Sharing my story enacts deep mapping as praxis: challenging the boundaries of field and research, I valorize ways of being and operating in the world and academy that generatively interfere with hegemonic norms of intelligibility and legibility. 

What stories/theories/interlocutors do I choose to practice/think/write with? What DONT I? 
>research-creation: "insisting we attend to those drives and desires that animate our stories—the stories that we find ourselves told by—and the ethics embedded in such modes of attention. The stories at stake here are not conscious. These aren’t simply stories that we mobilize, that we control. These are stories that grasp us as much if not more than we **grasp** them." (Loveless 2019, 95)

For me these stories are **Invisible Cities by Italo Calvino and Rhythmanalysis by Henri Lefebvre.** "...to grasp a rhythm it is necessary to have been grasped by it; one must let oneself go, give oneself over, abandon oneself to its duration. (Lefebvre. 27) --> Bridge --> good description of boundary practices of frames, why necessary, how made and remade through intra action
