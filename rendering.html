    <p style="text-align: center;"><b>RENDERING</b></p>
       
    How might geographic knowledge generated through everyday spatial practices be rendered public without being flattened, georeferenced, or vectorized? What exactly is rendered here - why this way - and how does both its form and formation come to matter? 
     
        <br><br><br>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><b>MAKING SPACE FOR DEEP MAPPING </b></p>
        negative-spaces.github.io and its constitutive code repository (per)form the output of my master's thesis in geography. Taken together, the web-field-site of my thesis output marks a praxis of interference while being itself the articulation of interference as praxis. So far, the pages of negative-spaces.github.io have introduced my practice of deep mapping and conveyed my theorization of deep mapping as generated through my practice. 
        <br><br> 
        This page articulates how my theorization of deep mapping––constituted through my practice of deep mapping––is enacted in both the form and formation of negative-spaces.github.io.
        <br><br>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><b>FORM</b>SITE</p>
        negative-spaces.github.io is itself a webbed field for deep mapping, a space for nonlinear exploration following ideas that grasp and pull the visitor. Until now, I have used this address to invoke the entire site. However, pasting this link into a web browser will bring you to an initial entry point only. My argument unfolds across multiple pages, each page connecting to a multiplicity of others via hyperlinks. Multimedia, rather than being relegated to an appendix, are integrated directly with text. Indeed, Cliffard McLucas (2000) said that renderings from deep mapping “will be genuinely multimedia, not as an aesthetic gesture or affectation, but as a practical necessity." <br><br>
        Digital form allows me to build for a variety of creative syncretisms such as parataxis (placing things side by side; a flat ontology where nothing is subordinated), montage (juxtaposition of disparate elements; connections implied by spatial contiguity), and commonplacing (an arrangement of resonant quotes; a literary topos) (Cresswell 2019, 1-20). [Elaborate on the different pages and what theyre doing!!! Like practice. ]
        
        My use of Github as a host platform was inspired by <a href=“https://sultanazana.github.io/” target=“_blank”> sultanazana.github.io</a>, whose “network of webpages will grow more tangled with time.” Conventionally used for managing code development for software projects, I chose Github as my host platform because it renders visible the iterative process of formation. github.com/negative-spaces/negative-spaces.github.io, the repository, contains the html documents which, once read by web browsers, comprise what’s read by browsers of this web-site. Each page of negative-spaces.github.io includes a link to its <a href=“https://github.com/negative-spaces/negative-spaces.github.io/blob/72709cffc3a94d9d54a2425431b7a2c5c802596d/index.html” target=“_blank”>constitutive html document</a>. In this way, process is embedded within the elements of product. 
        <br><br><br>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><b>FORMATION</b>TACTICS</p>
        I know how to make web maps, wield GIS, and construct cartesian cartographies. What I didn’t know a year ago was how I would render a geography in process and of process without tracing out my practice in a linear text.pdf. Tactics are methods whose validity is measured by their applicability to the situation at hand (de Certeau 1984). Appropriate use of tactics therefore depends on practical, experiential knowledge gleaned through everyday navigations of terrains physical, conceptual, and digital. In both field-research and site-creation I employ tactics of bricolage––the poetics of making do with what tools, skills, and materials are already around (Roberts 2018a). For example, instead of learning everything about coding and styling webpages before building my web-site, I teach myself what I need as I go, often gleaning (copypasting) snippets of open source code (as is custom) that are relevant to what I am attempting in the moment. Moreover, I picked up knowledge of git and Github through my job in GIS at the university library. Mapping deeply cultivates an awareness of what is around, gleaning information that may become useful later on.
