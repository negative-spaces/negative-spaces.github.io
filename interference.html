    When two or more waves occupy the same space in time they are said to be superpositioned. Superpositioned waves do not oppose one another but interfere, their displacements, or amplitudes, combining. Constructive interference occurs when the phase of superpositioned waves aligns. When the phase of superpositioned waves is out of synch, for example when the peak of one wave aligns with the trough of another, the result is destructive interference. The patterning of interference is called a diffraction pattern.

    Sometime in early pandemic quarantine, I performed a diffraction experiment of my own in a pitch-black bathroom for my undergraduate physics course. Using a laser pointer, I sent a beam of light through a piece of tinfoil with two razor-thin slits, both vertical and parallel to one another. On the wall beyond, a pattern of alternating bright and dark stripes appeared. I have recreated the set-up and detailed the experiment below. In the radial diagram, the solid lines represent the peaks and the dotted lines represent the troughs of the waves emanating from each slit, respectively.
    <br><br>
    [→with diagram of setup, images, and sketch of waves  ]
    <br><br>
    Passing through the tinfoil, the laster beam is bifurcated by the double slit. What is rendered visible on the wall beyond is a diffraction pattern marking the effects of the interference of these two beams of light. The bright stripes on the wall mark where constructive interference occurred, producing a new wave with increased amplitude intensified the light. The dark stripes mark the effect of destructive interference, where superpositioned waves were out of synch, effectively canceling each other out. This observation - of the diffraction pattern on the wall - was worth the postage required to ship DIY kits across the country because it illuminated first-hand the wave-particle duality of matter. The quantum of light is a photon, a subatomic particle. Yet particles occupy distinct positions. Since two particles cannot be in the same place at once, particles cannot produce diffraction patterns. Waves on the other hand, can and do.

    <br>
    Deep mapping disorients representationalist dualisms by assuming the field of encounter as interlocutor. In both deep mapping (practice) and making space for deep mapping (rendering), I aim to produce ‘situated knowledges’ wherein the object of knowledge is engaged as actor and agent (Haraway 1988, 592). Yet, much like places, objects are not preexisting entities but “boundary projects” whose “boundaries are drawn by mapping practices” (Haraway 1988, 595). Recall the cartography assignment introduced in <a href="./disorientation.html">disorientation.html</a>. Not only did tracing a map stand <i>in place</i> of spatial practice, the traced map stood in place of the map making practices which constituted it. The course assignment recommended a source statement of “Google Maps”, effectively erasing the illustration software with which the map was created, the computers on which the software ran, the internet connection and browsers which rendered Google Maps visible to screenshot, the lab instructions, my own directives and acquired technical expertise as course TA… in short, the entire apparatus of the map’s production. Thus, the assignment irresponsibly reproduced a “gaze from nowhere” (Haraway 1988, 581) whereby the producers of geographic knowledge (in this case, the mappers) remained unimplicated in, and therefore unaccountable to, the boundary drawing practices entailed in rendering an object of knowledge (in this case, a place). 
    <br><br>
    In a shift away from visual metaphors that privilege a “fixed position,” Haraway (1991, 70) suggests diffraction. She writes, “diffraction is a mapping of interference, not of replica­tion, reflection, or reproduction. A diffraction pattern does not map where differences appear, but rather <i>maps where the effects of difference appear</i>” (Haraway 1991, 70, emphasis mine). Encountering the effects of interference actually led to my first iteration at a theory of deep mapping. The following is from January 2022, my first winter in Vancouver.

      Some grey day I walked the stretch of shoreline that wraps around the University of British Columbia. With the Salish Sea on one side and a forest of evergreens and sword ferns to the other, campus is geographically and administratively separated from the City of Vancouver. It also occupies the traditional, ancestral, unceded territory of the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam) people. A five minute walk from the Geography Department takes me to a zig-zag staircase at the bottom of which awaits a place where clothing is optional. My shoes and socks are the first to come off. The sand is cold and firm, yet porous. It holds the impression of my soles and reshapes in my hands. I contain it for a moment, appreciating its texture, then let it go. 
      <br><br>
      Sunshine was a precious thing my first winter in Vancouver when it rained for four months straight. The cloud cover was so dense that a dimple of white was the only indication our star remained. Monochrome days used to really kill my vibe. There is a dullness to a landscape lit ambiently, a non-differentiation that makes it difficult to articulate thoughts. That day I paused at ocean’s edge where barnacles encrust the rocks and molluscs cling together in crunchy bundles. In and out rolled the waves, and I breathed with them. On each exhale I noticed how foam gathered around the rocks at my feet, forming bubbles on whose surface spun psychedelic spirals.

      </div>
      <br>
      This happens due to thin film interference, where light waves reflecting off the surface of a bubble are interfered with by waves which have been transmitted through the film, reflected back, and refracted at the surface at the angle of incidence. When refracted waves are shifted so as to be in-synch with those reflected, they interfere constructively to make visible an abundance of colors. Deep mapping is constructive interference with the superficial reflection that is place rendered (down from above) by flat maps. It's a multidimensional praxis of inhabiting, with all the sensorium, the city where I am. Geography on the ground. Mapping deeply requires entering the landscape––putting one’s self into the field––and emerging to render a cartography beyond the monochrome.

  <p>While walking False Creek that winter, I shared this idea with an interlocutor who recommended I read the above Haraway (1991) on diffraction. >>since then encountered Barad -> who draws on Haraway's diffraction. ->  quantum physics - superposition. limitations of classical physics. geometric optics etc. helped me theorize...

 Reading Barad (2007) and de Certeau (1984) through one another, I believe place and space to be phenomenal expressions of the world differentially articulated through trace and practice.
