# Thinking through Practice 
I explore and respond to these questions through urban **deep mapping, a practice of situated, embodied inhabitation by which I enter into dialogue with my surroundings** 

does not render down to a map in the cartesian sense, where action is made legible by the substitution of trace for practice (de certeau)

```
praxis of interference with hegemonic, top-down forms of ENGAGING & REPRESENTING PLACE, PRODUCING GEOGRAPHIC KNOWLEDGE, and RENDERING SPATIAL RESEARCH PUBLIC.
```
A mode of spatial analysis that accounts for rhythms that exceed measure, as they emerge in tension with time signatures; practical knowledge gleaned through practices of everyday life. layers that form depth of city inseparable - unlike discrete data layers loaded into GISystem for analysis, manipulation     

DM attends to **spatial anthropology,** what Les Roberts (2018b, 30) calls an attempt to name "the processes whereby the fundamental spatiality of being is woven into and from everyday practices, dispositions and experiential knowledge. To proceed on these terms ... is to understand and practice space as an existential ground of everyday being." 

"very little of what deep mappers are doing is in fact oriented towrads the production of maps so much as immersing themsevels in the warp and weft (OMG THIS WILL LEAD TO SENTENCE ON WEAVING A RHYTHM OF CARTOGRAPHIC PRAXIS BEYOND THE MONOCHROME) of a lived and fundamentally intersubjective spatiality."

My work is research-creation for I am driven by intellectual and spatial topoi which lure me forwards even before I comprehend where they lead (Loveless 2019, 95). (physical conceptual Derive)

Research-Creation: "How we do, think about, think-with our research practices—be they written, spoken, or danced—matters." (Loveless 70)

My theory of deep mapping is constituted through my practice of deep mapping. 

Praxis-Based research... iteration of theory and practice --> lemniscate and form drawing 
That sentence took nine months of writing and re-writing. My theory, the knowledge I produce, what my thesis is actually about - it all emerges from the iteration through theory and practice. To further describe the "iterative loops between action, experience, and knowledge" (Tuin and Verhoeff 2022, 138) which form my research (and whose form my research takes) I introduce the Lemniscate:
    
∞

The lemniscate is a form I grew up drawing and walking as part of Waldorf pedagogy. Beginning in first grade 1, along with 20 classmates, learned form drawing and Eurythmy. Eurythmy is "visible speech, visible music" / "music translated into movement" (Steiner 1923) - a spatial practice accompanied by piano whose every class began by walking a lemniscate for nearly ten minutes. Facing forward we flowed as one body in continuous motion. Although eurythmy was, without exception, our least favorite block, I have no doubt practicing it twice a week for eight years significantly developed my sense of spatial awareness. Also beginning in grade one was the practice of form drawing. Sitting in silence for an hour or more we would draw a form like the lemniscate over and over, the crayon in constant contact with the page. Form drawing is process oriented: "It is the _act_ of drawing that educates, not the result" (Gebert 1987, 8). The embodied iteration of patterns was a fundamental mechanism by which representational subjects like writing and arithmetic were later taught. My critiques of Waldorf pedagogy notwithstanding, I attribute my acute spatial awareness and orientation towards sensorium to my experience of "multisensory learning, where ears and eyes and voice, hands and feet, mind and memory, all work together to reinforce each other" (Gebert 1987, 12).
           
The lemniscate is the graphical (cartesian) rendering of an equation where the product of two foci is always one. A lemniscate is a curve derived from a constant relation, whereas a figure-eight is a symbol representing the concept of infinity. How then, does ∞, both form and symbol, relate to my spatial praxis and the formation of knowledge? 

This part is a bit tricky and theoretical but basically it turns out that introducing infinity into euclidean space allows parallel planes to intersect at that very point of infinity. Think perspective drawing where parallel sides of the street converge at one or more (focal) points on the horizon. My lemniscate-like looping through theory and practice is enacting an intersection of the conceptual and geographical fields. Though they may exist as parallel planes, the introduction of intervention ad infinitum is the very thing which brings them into dialogue. In this way I hope to, albeit circuitously, explain how deep mapping is thinking *with* the fields of encounter. 

Actually, perspective connects excellently to situated knowledge AND Lefebvre's right to the city 

"...to grasp a rhythm it is necessary to have been grasped by it; one must let oneself go, give oneself over, abandon oneself to its duration" (Lefebvre, 27).
