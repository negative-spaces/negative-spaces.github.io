        I take the 33 bus to campus on a whim. I'm running late to teach and I don't want to deal with the hassle of Broadway construction. Why have I never taken the 33 I wonder as a 5 minute walk brings me to an empty stop. I sit on a bench in the sun to catch my breath a moment before the bus pulls up. Its one of the smaller busses and the seats have the soft fabric patterned like a roller rink carpet. Riding the 33 is outside my routine. It's route takes me through places I've been before but have yet to connect via this navigation. ("I didn't realize the WISE was so close to Commercial! I came a different way last time. Oh, I remember walking through this park though! Okay, now I know where I am and where the WISE 'really is' on the map.") The city is daily reinvented in my imagination. (Constant shifting of field --> 'immersive cartography' concept by Roussell.)It emerges for me not through place making alone but from connections - spatial relationships - drawn by my moving in/out/through/between/among areas of familiarity/encounter.

        Navigations articulate a mental map of place. And, though forever evolving and contingent, as the the field becomes more densely networked with/through unique connections the more anchored in relation to one another specific areas or spots become. In this way, navigation makes navigable. For me, spatial awareness of the place I inhabit - that geographical field of my encounter - develops through embodied spatial practices (see tactics) including everyday navigations.  

    I wrote these thoughts initially in the whitespace of _A brief history of my body_ by Billy-Ray Belcourt. Around the margin, in the negative space of another story. Each time I leave home I carefully select which books to bring with me, not because I will necessarily read them, but more because I like their company. I bring along the people/stories/concepts I wish to think with for the day. Often I bring more than one book. I like to put texts into conversation first amongst themselves. In my bag they interlap, folding together they bookmark one another. Opening one, I open myself: read me. 

    More recently I boarded the 99 bus with Critical Concepts for the Creative Humanities. I brought this book because each concept is but a few pages - the distance between City Hall and MacDonald if you ride the 99 along Broadway. It opens to where I'd hastily tucked a crayon, to a page I'd never before been: Navigations. 

        "...navigation entails the production of a performative cartography of a terrain, field, or domain that is constituted in the very act of its exploration" (Tuin and Verhoeff 2022, 137-139).

    Just as navigating the geographical field articulates a mental map of physical space navigations within a conceptual field articulate a theoretical framework - a cognitive conceptualization of an emergent web of connection at which my ideas tug and pull. Following a concept in multiple directions I find myself making surprising connections. I write "follow" because when I loosen my desire to arrive at a specific place, when I release control of the destination as it were, I make room for latent connections to make themselves (apparent).  
    
    Exploration, put one way, is "the action of traveling in or through an unfamiliar area in order to learn about it." (https://bit.ly/3XeFxZw) Deep mapping is a practice of learning through disorientation. Though the field, geographical or conceptual, is at first unfamiliar, the iterative act of navigating, of finding ways around, coheres a framework of reference points which constitute the field of encounter. 
    
        "...navigation itself produces knowledge that feeds into its course and experience itself." (Tuin and Verhoeff 2022, 137-139) 
    
    Deep mapping is geography in practice. I think *with* the field of my encounter as it unfolds. Ideas connect while walking the bridge. Vantage affords me perspective of the field I've navigated. Individual places and concepts fall into context with one another in a way that's hard to envision from the ground. I pause at the apex to press my chest against the bridge. I feel at once its trembling vibration and my own heart’s rapid beating. My body in visceral contact with that of the city - its infrastructure - I embody for some duration the city’s rhythm.

My theory of deep mapping is constituted through my practice of deep mapping. 

That sentence took nine months of writing and re-writing. My theory, the knowledge I produce, what my thesis is actually about - it all emerges from the iteration through theory and practice. The form taken by "iterative loops between action, experience, and knowledge" (Tuin and Verhoeff 2022, 138) I imagine as a lemniscate:

Cassini curve "The French astronomer Giovanni Dominico Cassini (1625-1712) found the curves in 1680, while attempting to describe the movement of the earth relative to the sun" (https://www.2dcurves.com/quartic/quarticca.html)

        Spatial awareness, walking backwards
    Form Drawing
         "It is the _act_ of drawing that educates, not the result" (Gebert)
    cognative pathways 


Lemniscate as Infinity Symbol
     "The common symbol for infinity, ∞, was invented by the English mathematician John Wallis in 1655. " (britannica)


 >Conceptual and Geographical/physical field may be paralell planes, but in projective geometry "where infinity points are added to euclideean space" parallel lines do intersect at infinity.
 >> practice based --> iterative looping --> bring together fields fields brought together by iteration through theory and praxis : thus I weave, dance, or draw a thesis beyond the monochrome

   
    RELATES TO LIMITS 
    limits, counter, conduct, transgression, negative space


form itself is an unending wave 



it's a non-linear process which means 
picking start and end point --> arbitrary 

where to begin 
     -last winter - bubble, march -- negative space concept and constructive interference, may decision to do this as thesis though it was cartographic map based (open ended though) but even before undergrad thesis -- critical and creative cartography of pandemic including isolation psychogeography where i walked around in the woods. whole project was multi media website. 


"The bricoleur—as compared to, say, the scientist or engineer—is arguably less governed by an overarching awareness that they are embarked on a ‘project’, and that, correspondingly, they are performing in compliance with a clearly defined set of ‘aims’ or ‘objectives’. The idea that research might be conducted under conditions of aimlessness and without a clear objective in mind does not necessarily mean that it lacks the rigours of ‘accomplishment and execution’ but that much of what is fashioned in the process is contingent on factors that cannot always be foreseen. "

is why my output is intentionally non linear 
        Multiple navigations will be offered which guide the interlocutor through differing pathways amongst sections contained within the above groupings.
    also repetition of quotes places -- different ways they fit together 
        thesis not like a puzzle at all only one way everything fits together to produce an image, a map, a representation, rendering of my research. 
        no, this space is for your disoriented discovery. 
        have fun! i did:)



Deep mapping is geography in practice. I think *with* the field of my encounter as it unfolds for me. I am a process-oriented geographer who recognizes the journey, with all its detours, as a site of learning. Being lost is the beginning of exploration. Embracing the unknown unknown opens the deep-mapper-as-explorer to possibilities unlimited by expectation. To disoriented discovery.
