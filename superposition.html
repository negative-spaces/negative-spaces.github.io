      <p><i>Many stories exist in the landscape</i>, says a wooden frame erected at Jericho Beach Park, <i>What do you see?</i> Do different stories render different cities? Or is it, as so exquisitely suggested by Italo Calvino's Invisible Cities (1974), that different framings focus a city differently, evoking a multiplicity of stories, each one rendering some aspects of a landscape legible to the exclusion of others? <br><br>
      I am a bricoleur-as-researcher, conducting transdisciplinary investigations into everyday urban geographies through both affective and technoscientific research practices. Thinking with my ongoing work in Cartesian cartography, GIS, and deep mapping, I have grown critical of academic framings that render so-called 'top-down' and 'bottom-up' mapping practices in opposition to one another. Both are boundary making practices for configuring worlds. What matters is the effect of their differential articulations of what gets to count––what is included in the frame of an empirical formation. What becomes intelligible is not an innocent matter, however, for the constitution of a determinate form entails the exclusion of all other/ed possible configurations. What is needed to produce 'situated knowledges' (Haraway 1988) of the place one inhabits is not reflexivity on the part of the researcher, or an approach which counters the hegemonic one, but an account of how differences come to matter as the effect of boundary making practices.
      <br><br>Reimagining referent "the city" from a fixed and bounded object to a phenomenon, dynamically figured through 'intra-actions' (Barad 2007), allows for a multiplicity of stories to be superpositioned in one place. The indeterminacy of which story comes to matter is resolved by boundary making practices which differentially frame the landscape. Accounting for boundary making practices is important in order to remain responsive to how some stories become privileged while others are "excluded from mattering" (Barad 2007, 220). >>What I have excluded etc.</p>

          <p>
            After my symposium presentation I was asked: "Are you more of a wave or a particle?" All I could think to say then was "interesting how you've framed the question as an either or..." <br><br>I've been holding the question in mind since - subconsciously mostly - until a thought came one morning like the momentary illumination of lighting:<br><br>
            I am (we are all) both wave and particle. Although routinely apprehended as individuals, fixed, bounded, defined bodies, we are permeable - continuously transfiguring through encounters, experiencing life as a process transforming and transfiguring through intra-action. We emanate waves (affect) which interfere and are interfered with by others, human and nonhuman. To practice deep mapping is to embody superposition. Paradox is not a closure but an opening - to possibilities - the existence of multiple states, simultaneous multiplicities, inextricable layers.

            praxis is diffractive -- thinking through practice, enacting interference, mapping differences, generating new patterns. WHEN ITS ALL THE FIELD EVERYWHERE BECOMES A SITE FOR PRAXIS
            ***Deep mapping :: research-creation ::  interference :: diffraction :: transformation through encounter, two waves (rhythms) are spatiotemporally aligned and in so being alter and are altered by one another producing a new wave (subject/object, researcher/field, Lily/City)***
           <br><br>
            Praxis is both a site and tactic of interference (site: superposition, duh, layering, rendering of diffraction or thinking through practice) (tactic: interfering from within system with circles boundary of legibility, valorizing otherwise intelligible forms)
            <br><br>
            also github - literally renders marks of similarities and differences -> merge-> overlays
            <br>
            READING between the lines -- negative space -- then diffractive analysis - literally reading between both sets of lines. similarities and differences. light and dark. both the field
            <Br><br>
              Theory and practice, toolbox (tactics) (Deleuze and Foucault)
Praxis denotes the inseparability of theory and practice.<br>
Theory as Praxis<br>
its all the field (ex. conference, symposium)<br>
this site, its form and formation, site and tactic of dm, praxis<br>
cIRcle interference with system from within - restructuring, recoding<br>
ethico-ontoepistemology (barad) - inseparability of "self" from research practice, <br>field - what this means - how i show up<br><br>
My interest is in the layered multiplicities not the single story.<br>
Less about reframing but widening the frame thinking about what is outside the frame, what is inside, the shape of the frame and why.<br>
Bella and I have this refrain: Its all the field.<br>
