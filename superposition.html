        <!-- <span style="font-weight:700">MANY STORIES EXIST IN THE LANDSCAPE</span><br> -->
        <i>Many stories exist in the landscape</i>, says a wooden frame erected at Jericho Beach Park, <i>What do you see?</i> Do different stories render different cities? Or is it, as so exquisitely suggested by Italo Calvino's Invisible Cities (1974), that different framings focus a city differently, evoking a multiplicity of stories, each one rendering some aspects of a landscape legible to the exclusion of others?

      I am a bricoleur-as-researcher, conducting transdisciplinary investigations into everyday urban geographies through both affective and technoscientific research practices. I craft multimodal artifacts which perform bricolage with the physical-conceptual fields of my encounter. In my master's research-creation, I explored thinking with place and feeling the city through deep mapping, or situated, embodied inhabitation as a practice of ongoing and open-ended dialogue with the world. Much of my fieldwork has involved navigating Vancouver, my empirics emerging as inextricable layerings of sensorium, affect, and infrastructure. Alongside my thesis I have TAed a departmental cartography course as well as completed cartographic research assistance and freelance cartography. I also work in the university library, teaching and consulting on geospatial matters as well as developing and facilitating workshops on mapping and geographic information systems (GIS).
     </p>

    <p>
      One of the workshops I led for UBC Library's Research Commons was on building walkability indexes with GIS. GIS, or geographic information systems, are the computational programs, desktop applications, and infrastructural hardware that facilitate the distribution, visualization, and analysis of geospatial data. Geospatial data are data for which a locational property, such as coordinate or street address, is measured. Much like excel assists in performing mathematical calculations on numerical datasets or Nvivo helps highlight patterns across qualitative records, GIS assist in performing spatial analysis on georeferenced datasets. A walkability index is a quantitative assessment of the relative accessibility of amenities within a delineated area. The workshop assumed as its empirics geospatial datasets which render the city down from above as a collection of points, lines, and polygons. Indeed, it is possible to make the  entire index without any reference to on-the-ground, everyday navigations. Given geospatial data representing Vancouver's city blocks, population density, and amenities, GIS provides the tools to analyze proximity and connection, as well as visualize the result through a map.
    </p>
    <p>
      Around the same time as I was preparing to present the walkability workshop, I began noticing these '15 minute City <span style="font-weight:500">Ready</span>' stickers popping up along the Vancouver Greenway, a stretch of the old Canadian Pacific railroad that's been transposed into a designated pedestrian and bike path. Conceptualized by city planner Carlos Moreno, the '15 minute city' is the idea “that cities should be designed or redesigned so that, within the distance of a 15-minute walk or bike ride, people should be able to live the essence of what constitutes the urban experience: to access work, housing, food, health, education, culture and leisure” (Moreno 2020). Over the course of the spring, more stickers appeared, pasted over DO NOT ENTER EXCEPT BICYCLES signs and those yellow/black striped hazard markers. At the same time that the stickers began proliferating east, west, and even across the bridge into downtown, they also began being scratched off. Reapplication, however, was swift. Then I sighted something different: at first one then two sites, scrawled in blue sharpie over '15 minute City <span style="font-weight:500">Ready</span>' was the declaration RESIST.
      </p>

      <p>
        But resist what? Well it turns out the '15 minute City <span style="font-weight:500">Ready</span>' stickers are actually in protest of the ‘15 minute city’––the decal’s chain-link background representing enforced limited mobility. The location and surface of the stickers' placement is therefore significant. The signification of protest comes to matter through the stickers’ material-semiotic interference with infrastructural boundary demarcations. City signs become palimpsests––sites of super/im/position signaling contested urbanisms. This led me to think about how proximity and connection are measured, the city imagined, and urban space produced through both technoscientific and affective spatial practices. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Thinking with my ongoing work in Cartesian cartography, GIS, and deep mapping, I have grown critical of academic framings that render so-called 'top-down' and 'bottom-up' mapping practices in opposition to one another. Both are boundary making practices for configuring worlds. What matters is the effect of their differential articulations of what gets to count––what is included in the frame of an empirical formation. What becomes intelligible is not an innocent matter, however, for the constitution of a determinate form entails the exclusion of all other/ed possible configurations. What is needed to produce 'situated knowledges' (Haraway 1988) of the place one inhabits is not reflexivity on the part of the researcher, or an merely an approach which counters the hegemonic one, but an account of <i>how</i> differences come to matter as the effect of boundary making practices.

            After my symposium presentation I was asked: "Are you more of a wave or a particle?" All I could think to say then was "interesting how you've framed the question as an either or..." <br><br>I've been holding the question in mind since - subconsciously mostly - until a thought came one morning like the momentary illumination of lighting:<br><br>
            I am (we are all) both wave and particle. Although routinely apprehended as individuals, fixed, bounded, defined bodies, we are permeable - continuously transfiguring through encounters, experiencing life as a process transforming and transfiguring through intra-action. We emanate waves (affect) which interfere and are interfered with by others, human and nonhuman. To practice deep mapping is to embody superposition. Paradox is not a closure but an opening - to possibilities - the existence of multiple states, simultaneous multiplicities, inextricable layers.

            praxis is diffractive -- thinking through practice, enacting interference, mapping differences, generating new patterns. WHEN ITS ALL THE FIELD EVERYWHERE BECOMES A SITE FOR PRAXIS
            ***Deep mapping :: research-creation ::  interference :: diffraction :: transformation through encounter, two waves (rhythms) are spatiotemporally aligned and in so being alter and are altered by one another producing a new wave (subject/object, researcher/field, Lily/City)***
           <br><br>
            Praxis is both a site and tactic of interference (site: superposition, duh, layering, rendering of diffraction or thinking through practice) (tactic: interfering from within system with circles boundary of legibility, valorizing otherwise intelligible forms)
            <br><br>
            also github - literally renders marks of similarities and differences -> merge-> overlays
