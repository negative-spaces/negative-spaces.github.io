  <!--intro-->
<div>
  <p>
    How, then, might the effect of interferences be marked while accounting for the apparatus of their production? In other words, how might knowledge generated through everyday spatial practices be rendered without being flattened, georeferenced, or vectorized? This page is an account of the form and formation of negative-spaces––the website which marks the effects of my deep mapping practice and constitutes the contents of what I will submit as my master’s thesis in geography. In what follows, I articulate how making space for deep mapping renders theory as praxis. In doing so, I attend to the exclusions entailed in defining my research output and rendering it intelligible to the sociotechnical system of institutional graduate publishing. The archival of negative-spaces within UBC's institutional repository will performatively render my research-creation output legible as an MA thesis.

  I will submit as my master of arts (MA) thesis in geography a file entitled ubc_2024_may_crandalloral_lilydemet_negative-spaces.zip. What’s in a filename turns out to matter quite a bit to the powers that be. Consequently, the following section will break down the file name's concatenation to show how my submission interferes with formal convention. cIRcle (circle.ubc.ca) is the institutional repository for The University of British Columbia (UBC) where I am pursuing a Master of Arts (MA) degree in geography. The mandate of cIRcle is to preserve archived material <i>in perpetuity</i> as I was told, a commitment reiterated by the default search date range of the repository’s open collection being 1982 BCE to 2024 (“Search - UBC Library Open Collections” n.d.). UBC began accepting electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs) as a pilot project in 2007, and now requires all theses and dissertations be submitted electronically to cIRcle. From the perspective those spearheading the endeavor, it marked a shift from the Dark Ages of thesis submission and archiving to The Age of Light (Read and Sprout 2009). The collaboration between UBC Library and the Faculty of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies responsible for the initiative persists today, though remains a complex sociotechnical system in which “acceptance” and “approval” of submissions is a distributed decision. This is especially true, I learned, when it comes to formats for which there is no technical precedent. That is, no precedent of the proposed thesis format nor for submission and archival by cIRcle. 
  <br><br>
  Never before in the history of UBC thesis submission has one taken the form of a website. 
  <br><br>
  Deep mapping is a practice of interference, not opposition. I was keen therefore to talk with the Public Scholarship Coordinator and Associate Director of Student Academic Services within the Faculty of Graduate in Postdoctoral Studies (GP+S) well in advance of my intended submission date so as to find a way for my thesis to be archived by cIRcle. Also in attendance to our meeting was Dr. Luke Bergmann, my thesis co-supervisor. As it stood on the afternoon of July 13th, 2023, the time of our meeting, in order for theses and dissertations to be accepted by cIRcle’s submission platform they were required to be uploaded in the format ubc_gradyear_gradmonth_lastname_firstname.pdf (“Library:Circle/Uploading Electronic Theses and Dissertations - UBC Wiki” 1-18-2023). Given that “cIRcle can technically accept all file formats” (“Library:Circle/File Format Guidelines - UBC Wiki” 2023), upload of auxiliary multimedia was, and continues to be, an option. Searching cIRcle’s collection of MA and MSc (Master of Science) theses (“Search - UBC Library Open Collections” n.d.), I found a handful of theses with supplementary files. In addition to the text theses in .pdf form, archived MA theses included still images (as .gif files), moving image/audiovisual (as .m4v and .mp4 files), datasets (as .csv, .sav, .txt, and .zip files), and sound/audio (as .zip, .wav, and .mp3 files). Supplementary datasets, models, and software were more prevalent amongst MSc submissions, archived as .zip, .mp4, and, .xlsx files. However, all multimedia were submitted as <i>secondary</i> to a ubc_gradyear_gradmonth_lastname_firstname.pdf formatted upload. 
  <br><br>
  In conversation with the Associate Director of Student Academic Services and the Public Scholarship Coordinator on July 13th, 2023, my thesis co-supervisor and I indicated hesitance over submitting any .pdf files since my entire thesis would be rendered by my website, to which their response was that they were "not convinced" and, more importantly, we would have build an argument to "convince" The Faculty of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies as to why inclusion of a 3 to 5 page .pdf would "damage" my thesis. They held that the first few pages of the conventional monograph contain vital metadata. This despite that my proposed website met exactly these requirements (title page, committee page, abstracts). I also reiterated that upon the submission of an electronic thesis or dissertation submission, cIRcle requires an abstract and metadata––including title, creator, supervisor(s), publisher, date issued, description, degree, program, affiliation, graduation date, and degree grantor––to all be manually entered. The content of these fields is then displayed for each archived thesis alongside the downloadable thesis file(s). If both my thesis website and the platform archiving it contain the vital metadata, including it in a .pdf is repetitive. It also requires a reader download, open, and read a .pdf before engaging the thesis. To this, the Associate Director of Student Academic Services cited convention––theses at UBC have "always" been submitted with a linear text component. 
<br><br>
The bottom line, I gathered, was that while multimedia files <i>can technically</i> be accepted by cIRcle’s infrastructure and there is no formal rule that ETDs must be submitted with a .pdf, <i>the linear text .pdf is what makes a submission legible, or “acceptable”, to The Faculty of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies as a thesis.</i> That is, until four hours after our conversation. 
<br><br>
Four hours after my co-supervisor and I spoke with representatives of The Faculty of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies, the UBC Library webpage for uploading ETDs to cIRcle, which hadn’t been updated in six months, was refigured to include upload instructions and requirements to account for multi-file theses. The new mandate requires a text .pdf file be <i>the primary document</i> uploaded (see site 1). All other multimedia uploads, including .zip files, are now determined to be <i>secondary to the .pdf</i>  (“Library:Circle/Uploading Electronic Theses and Dissertations: Difference between Revisions - UBC Wiki” 7-13-2023).  Below is an excerpt from <a href="https://wiki.ubc.ca/index.php?title=Library:Circle/Uploading_Electronic_Theses_and_Dissertations&diff=760286&oldid=760285" target="_blank">the full history log</a> of that day.

  What to do? In a voice recording taken while driving the Coquihalla Highway back to Vancouver days before the meeting I said: “It's less about the specific output form of my website and more about the process of interfering with the cIRcle system from within by proposing this.” This is not to say my chosen form doesn’t matter, but rather, in a Baradian vein, how it comes to matter is the result of boundary making practices through which the boundary of an intelligible (read “acceptable”) form becomes articulate.

  As I mentioned in <a href="./disorientation" target="_blank">negative-spaces/disorientation.html, </a>I did not begin my master's with a distinct goal or idea about the shape my output would take. In the spring of 2022, I first began envisioning possibilities. Not until that Fall did I decide to make a digital space, inspired by a simple iteration I'd created to render the final project of my counter cartographies course.

  Even the following Spring, when I first reached out to the Public Scholarship Coordinator, I didn't know how I would archive my emerging website. Indeed, that was my motive for reaching out. Well, my pragmatic impulse. My other aim in initiating a dialogue with the Faculty of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies was to get a sense of how the institution conceived legibility, and where its limit lay. The form in which I submit my MA thesis has come to matter as the effect of the July 13th conversation, as well as many in-depth conversations with my thesis co-supervisor, Dr. Luke Bergmann. I will submit as my master’s thesis in geography the file ubc_2024_may_crandalloral_lilydemet_negative-spaces.zip, along with a brief PDF with metadata, the last page of which provides instructions on how to download and unzip the compressed file, negative-spaces, and navigate the webbed site it contains. These instructions are also included in a README.txt file within negative-spaces.

  Why locate my work in negative-spaces? The idea was inspired by a sticker on a lamppost I noticed while thinking with an intersection downtown (see site 2). It read: AVOID THE SUBJECT.

    In visual art, negative space refers to that which surrounds the subject but is not the intended focus of attention. I know this concept from years of practical experience as a painter. Negative space gives definition to the intelligible form by being that which the intelligible form is not. The boundary, or difference between intelligible and <i>un</i>intelligible, is articulated in the instant that which the intelligible form excludes shows up within the space of the intelligible. Negative space and intelligibility are in relation not of opposition but of complementary constitution––an entanglement I believe to be analogous to (if not the same as) Foucault’s (1977) rendering of limit and transgression. Writes Foucault, “transgression carries the limit right to the limit of its being; transgression forces the limit to face the fact of its imminent disappearance, to find itself in what it excludes…” (Foucault 1977, 34). Interference at once articulates difference and redraws boundaries by bringing what was previously unintelligible into focus.

  <!--parking lot vignette-->
  <div id="scroll-box1" style="height:200px;  margin:auto;">
    Just under Cambie Bridge there's a large fenced off lot with construction materials. Passing this area on a walk around False Creek, we notice a portion of the fencing has been wrenched apart. We slip inside to find derelict garden beds where last year's plantings are going to seed. Following a slim path further, we encounter an overgrown gravel dump strewn with large slabs of broken cement. The garbage of previous inhabitants has piled up and we step carefully, avoiding the serrated edges of building blocks, rusty wires, and sharps. Where are we? What secluded place have we stumbled upon, lured by the invitation of an unexpected opening? Emerging from the dump, we see that we are inside the lot, though a ways away from the wooden pallets and parked construction vehicles. We continue forward down an unpaved road, aware, now, of how exposed we are in a place we are likely not supposed to be. Ahead is a warehouse, dark and empty. Its sides are composed of a collage of corrugated panels, as if the goal were to keep people from seeing in rather than protecting anything inside from weather. As we near, a parking lot comes into view. One of those unkept expanses of asphalt with the pay-to-park kiosk in the corner. A handful of cars are clustered around the kiosk, close to the entrance. No barrier separates the road from the parking lot from us. Had we wandered in from this side, we might not have been drawn to explore further. And if we had, felt little sense of unease. From the side of the parking lot closest to the adjacent park, a foot path runs back through the overgrowth directly to the garden beds. When did we enter the intelligible form of the parking lot? Why put a fence on one side of the gravel dump but not the other?

  Intelligibility is not a static state but the result of boundary drawing practices; what constitutes negative space is therefore provisional, continuously figured and refigured in relation to the intelligible form. Locating my thesis in negative-spaces brings to the fore forms of knowledge production and rendering spatial research public that are institutionally rendered outside the norm. And, in doing so, negative-spaces enacts an interference which redraws the definition of possibility. It’s not one against another (opposition) but a Baradian 'intra-action' (Barad 2007) which reveals the limit through the transgressive act of proposing alternative framings. This is the work of reconfiguring boundaries. It is to the configuration and configured form of my thesis that I now turn.

    <br>
    The filetype of my thesis is .zip, meaning my submission is a compressed folder. In the case of my thesis, the compressed (zipped) folder contains files of heterogenous types (.html, .css, .md, .txt., .png, .jpeg, .jpg, .mp3, .mp4, .ttf, .zip, .pdf) sorted into additional folders. The .zip format therefore assembles a multitude of files into one element. Once archived by cIRcle, to explore my MA thesis a visitor will need a computer, internet connection, and web browser––all agencies required to access cIRcle in the first place. From circle.ubc.ca, the repository's public-facing graphical user interface (GUI), a visitor would then navigate to 'theses and dissertations' where they would find my thesis using relevant search terms. They would then download ubc_2024_may_crandalloral_lilydemet_negative-spaces.zip. Once downloaded, the .zip file is located "locally" on their personal computer, likely in user/downloads. This as opposed to it being stored "remotely" on cIRcle servers. 
    <br><br>
    The .zip folder is a "release"––a version in time or instantaneous configuration of the assorted files constitutive of the website negative-spaces.github.io, hosted by Github. Github is a platform conventionally used for managing code development for software projects. It is a popular site for team work because collaborators can work asynchronously on a project by "cloning" it to their local device and then "pushing" their changes "upstream" to the remote project hosted by Github. Github integrates git, a version control software which allows users to track changes made to files and handle complex merges, i.e., cases where multiple collaborators push changes to the same document. I was initially inspired to appropriate the conventional use of Github by sultanazana.github.io, whose "network of webpages will grow more tangled with time" (Zana n.d.). I also chose Github as the host platform for the development of my thesis website because it provided a means to render visible the iterative process of my site's formation. While the website located at negative-spaces.github.io will remain as long as Github exists, I made the decision to submit as my thesis as a release of the site so that what counts as my thesis is materially archived within cIRcle, instead of being a link to some external location. However, drawing this boundary means the "commit history"––an archive of each document as it was changed and a diffraction pattern marking the site's iterative formation––is not included as part of my formal thesis submission. However, this element of process can still be accessed at <a href="https://github.com/negative-spaces/negative-spaces.github.io/commits/main" target="_blank">github.com/negative-spaces/negative-spaces.github.io/commits/main </a>for those curious. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Once downloaded, the contents of a zipped folder are not immediately accessible. As you may know from practical experience, in order to access the contents of a .zip file you must first "unzip" or otherwise extract the compressed folder. A now-common way to do this is to right-click the .zip file and choose an extraction software with which to unzip the file. If the computer is set up to automatically recognize a .zip file and extract its contents upon double-clicking, that is an option too. The extracted folder is named negative-spaces. The folder negative-spaces contains the .html documents which, once read by web browsers, render what's read by browsers of my web site. It also contains the Cascading Style Sheet (.css file) responsible for the rendered look and feel of my website. Images, video, and audio files are organized into subfolders of negative-spaces, linked by specific file paths that embed them as relevant throughout the html pages. From the access instructions archived as a .pdf alongside ubc_2024_may_crandalloral_lilydemet_negative-spaces.zip: negative-spaces is a partial account of an ongoing and open-ended conversation, one which invites the visitor to engage as interlocutor. How, then, might one enter into dialogue?
    <br>
    <br>
    Within the folder negative-spaces, visitors are instructed to right click any of the .html files and "open with" their default web browser. In this way, my thesis is 'intra-actively' (Barad 2007) rendered. While negative-spaces is an instantaneous configuration of files, each in a necessarily distinct location, navigation spatializes it, producing a webbed site itself a space for nonlinear exploration following ideas that grasp and pull the visitor. For evaluating supervisors and those desiring a guided tour, I have ordered the menu by my recommended navigation. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Upon 'intra-active' (Barad 2007) production of the digital space, visitors will find multimedia, rather than relegated to secondary material or the appendix of a .pdf, integrated directly with text on the page. As Cliffard McLucas (2000) said, what's rendered of deep mapping "will be genuinely multimedia, not as an aesthetic gesture or affectation, but as a practical necessity." Rendering in the digital form allows me to build for a variety of creative syncretisms. Drawing inspiration from Tim Cresswell, I employ tactics of writing place such as parataxis (placing elements side by side), montage (juxtaposition of disparate elements), and commonplacing (an arrangement of resonant quotes) (Cresswell 2013). Take for example my page on practice, <a href="./practice.html" target="_blank">negative-spaces/practice.html,</a> which traces my theorization of deep mapping by setting up a dialogue between the physical and conceptual fields of my encounter. I format this conversation as digital commonplace: embedded on the left are passages from the conceptual field; on the right, interpretations of deep mapping generated through navigating Vancouver. The form of practice.html is therefore akin to my practice of deep mapping. The interlocutor is invited to <i>think through practice</i> in order to arrive at a situated theory, and do so in the form of a dialogue. Form thus becomes a site of praxis.

<p>
  <span style="font-weight:700">SITATION: CITING SITUATED PRACTICES as MULTIMODAL KNOWLEDGES</span><br>
  Citation is a form of address, a formal acknowledgement of an other within the written conversation of an academic text. Mott and Cockayne (2017) call for conscientious engagement in citation as a performative practice for resisting "hegemonies of knowledge production and authority" within the neoliberal university that reify white, cisgendered, heteromasculinist narratives (959). They do not mention ableism. Their audience is other professors (citing narrowly, they write, does a disservice to "our students"). What does conscientious engagement mean for graduate students, especially master’s students like myself who come to human geography from physical geography or who are entirely new to a discipline? When choosing what to read (this already presupposes a clear understanding of what a project is about), how does one account for time constraints, for expectations on bibliography length and breadth over depth? Conscientious engagement might also include mention of how one happened upon a text (Was it required reading? An interlocutor’s recommendation? A serendipitous find?), and whether it was read deeply or perfunctorily. Additionally, Mott and Cockayne (2017) focus on the content of bibliographies rather than the form of citation. Challenging content-oriented interdisciplinarity, Natalie Loveless (2019) suggests a ‘polydisciplinamorous’ ethic that attends to how one relates to the various fields drawn upon and the ways in which one's research forms kinship ties. Conscientious engagement should not only be about whom we cite but <i>how</i>. I suggest the <i>form</i> of in-text citation to be a site as well as tactic for interfering with what Mott and Cockayne (2017, 959) identified as "hegemonies of knowledge production and authority" in academia.
  <br><br>
  Throughout the pages of negative-spaces, instead of transcribing block quotes from books and printed articles, I’ve scanned my marked-up readings and embedded them in the page so as to trace my process of thinking together with the fields of my encounter. I call this form of citation sitation. Sitation cites a reading practice that is situated and embodied. Flipping back and forth through pages, annotating, highlighting, creasing corners––all help me process information. Iterative readings transform pages into palimpsests, sites of interference marked by the 'intra-active' (Barad 2007) dialogue of encounter. Thoughts scribbled avidly around margins, different colored crayon marks from each re/reading, wrinkles, folds, and even torn pages, coffee stains and watermarks from rain––all these remind me of the material context in which I engaged a piece, thus aiding in my recall of ideas and connections. Embedding quotes in the form of images practices conscientious engagement with the form of citation. It performatively valorizes process as a site of knowledge production, refusing to conform to normative formats that determine what is included (and excluded) within what’s rendered of academic research. By framing marginalia, reading between the lines, and ideas located in negative spaces as sites of knowledge production, sitation cites a praxis of slow scholarship that counts what matters differently (Mountz et al. 2015). Sitation acknowledges a “<i>temporal</i> and <i>material</i> attunement within the academy that require[s] slowing down in a way that does not fetishize the slow but in which slowness comes from the work of defamiliarization and the time it takes to <i>ask questions differently</i>” (Loveless 2019, 107, emphasis in original).  I have taken 3 years to complete my master's degree because I approached my project from a state of disorientation, asking open-ended questions like "What could it mean to think with place? To feel the city?" I did not begin with the means to answer these questions, or even realize they were my research questions until, having cultivated a deep mapping practice, I found myself asking them out of curiosity. 
  <br><br>
  I also want to acknowledge, and this is important, that sometimes slowness/slowing down is not a choice. This may be for various reasons such as existing or acquired disability, long covid, chronic illness, familial commitments, external responsibilities, or financial pressures. The following is an excerpt written for the departmental introductory seminar all incoming human geography graduates are required to take together.

                   Early in the term Professor K made a joke in which she recalled a professor whose class was so hard, its difficulty was measured by the number of students who committed suicide. I was silent in the forced laughter that followed. Discussion resumed. I express now what I couldn’t find the words to say then: people die by suicide because they believe there is no possible way to go on. The hopelessness of students in the face of unrelenting academic pressure is not at all funny.

                    The business enterprise of academic life in the neoliberal university produces a work rhythm that is rushed, riddled with anxiety and pressure to be ever-present. Sometimes life gets in the way. Overwhelming pressures can lead to paralysis, and scholarship can come to a complete halt. (Mountz et al. 2015, 1244)

                  Something had to shift and if it wasn’t the system (just yet) it would have to be my relation to it. What I learned from writing the progress report was this: taking care of my body-mind is more important than meeting a deadline because the body-mind will break down long before the system. Sometimes, denying extensions puts a student in the position of feeling like there is no possible path forward. Putting students in a position so antithetical to learning is poor teaching and far from a classroom joke. I didn’t ask permission to submit this journal late because I already gave myself permission to prioritize my health and wellbeing. That such boundary setting on my part should feel so radical reveals just how normalized the expectation is in academia that (graduate) students treat their body-mind like a commodity.

        Immutable deadlines can be disabling. Immutable deadlines do not necessarily translate to rigorous scholarship. In deciding to give myself an extra weekend to finish that seminar assignment, I exercised 'crip willfullness', refusing to extend myself beyond my capacity to "act in accordance with the system of compulsory able-bodiedness" (Johnson and McRuer 2014, 136). Institutional support for research-focused neurodivergent graduate students is scant in my experience. Institutional accommodations also require formal diagnoses––access to which poses numerous hurdles especially to financially precarious and/or international students, for whom diagnoses made in other countries are not necessarily honored by Canada. After great ordeal and personal expense, I registered with the University of British Columbia's Center for Accessibility only to be told that the one accommodation I desperately needed––hard-copy print outs of required readings––was not deemed an accessibility issue by the university. While they could easily offer me digital formats, I was on my own for obtaining what I expressed was necessary in order for me to progress alongside my peers. Thankfully, I gleaned a printer from the alleyway shortly thereafter, an interlocutor who has remained a close companion ever since. It's worth pausing, however, over the fact that even after I labored to make my disability legible to the institution through formal diagnosis, the Center for Accessibility retained the power to determine how my being ADHD impacted me in academia rather than the other way around.
        <br><br>
        Slowing down (without medical documentation or the permission of those in authority) is risky business while situated in an economy of knowledge production that rewards consistent cognitive capacity, swift processing and synthesis of new information, considerate executive function to initiate, respond, and follow-up with time-sensitive correspondence, financial means and physical energy to attend conferences, social battery to network with new people and maintain a growing number of relationships, tolerance of the status quo, etc., etc.. But the reality is that progress is not always linear or of consistent intensity for reasons often out of our immediate control.

            The city is hazy and so am I. I wake up late, spend till noon fighting the residual stupor of sleeping pills. Insomnia comes in waves; I pray it ebbs. I do five things at once without thinking: I wash the dishes while putting away glasses. I drop them. I sweep them up and the faucet is still running. I try to eat. Choke. I'm unable to swallow like my body is rejecting input. I'm out of breath, my senses dulled. I go for a walk and find myself lost in familiar places. I wander around listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0nmHymgM7Y" target="_blank">You want it darker</i></a> on repeat. The mountains have  disappeared and even downtown is fading away. I think I've opened myself so wide to feeling the city that when it's hazy so am I.

    Cognitive capacity is not always a given, even on clear days. Sometimes the haziness begins inside my head. Everyday is a practice of negotiating myself into focus. I often joke about this but honestly, in order to think and write and map and teach and do all the tasks expected of me as a graduate student and cartographer, I need to regulate 4 hours out of every day. My regulation activities include cooking, painting, cleaning, crafting whatever comes to my imagination, and playing music.   This means the perceived pace of my progress on one project, my thesis for example, may seem slow. Along with regulating activities, medication is a tool I use to help me meet neurotypical expectations of productivity. Though useful for some, prescription stimulants don't simply 'fix' ADHD because ADHD isn't reducible to a deficit that can be pinpointed and counteracted. Medication expands my capacity to read and write because it helps me sit still and not be so disrupted by distractions. Medication helps me regulate my emotions, making me more resilient amidst daily ups and downs. Medication aids in my executive functioning, allowing me to initiate movement throughout the day whether it be getting up to make lunch, transitioning to a different task, or transiting to a new location. However, medication is not going to change my need to work with hard-copies. Another consideration for pacing scholarship is that adjusting to new medications takes time and compatibility is unpredictable. The rhythm of my research over the past three years has therefore been disrupted at times by unforeseen factors. Johnson and McRuer (2014) suggest 'cripistemology' to account for modes of "thinking from the critical, social, and personal position of disability" (134). Cripistemologies validate practical knowledge. For instance, from my lived experience of conducting research as an ADHDer, I've gained the practical knowledge of what accommodations will support my work and what counts as part of my research process. This I know: the institution denying me accommodation does not mean I no longer have an accessibility need but rather that the expression of my disability is unintelligible to the institution. Sitations are therefore sites of 'crip willfulness' (Johnson and McRuer 2014). Sitations site forms of engaging literature and generating knowledge that are situated in the physical-conceptual reality of thinking and being (and being able to) in ways institutional "hegemonies of knowledge production and authority" (Mott and Cockayne 2017, 959) systemically render unintelligible. In this way, sitation is an example of 'cutting our own keys' (Bertilsdotter Rosqvist et al. 2023)––of inventing concepts for neurodivergent storying based on my embodied experience within and as part of the fields of my encounter.

  As mentioned in negative-spaces/disorientation.html, negative-spaces/practice.html and negative-spaces/interference.html, deep mapping disorients Cartesian dualisms by assuming the physical-conceptual field of encounter as interlocutor. But what if it is through the acknowledgement of encounter––i.e. citation––that field and researcher become intelligible as different formations? The posthumanist performativity of Barad’s 'agential realism' (2007) urges consideration of the boundary drawing practices, or apparatuses, through which boundaries such as human|nonhuman are differentially constituted. As discussed in negative-spaces/interference.html, Barad defines apparatuses as ongoing and open-ended material-discursive boundary making practices which resolve the indeterminacy of a property by performing an "agential cut" whereby the "agencies of observation" and "object of observation" are differentially articulated. "Agencies of observation" and "object of observation" are provisional configurations––entangled states which "intra-actively" mark (mutually constitute) one another within and as part of phenomena. According to Barad's agential realism, "measured properties refer to phenomena…" (Barad 2007, 197, emphasis in original). By this account, field and researcher are intra-actively produced through the research process, rendering being one of the many ongoing and open-ended boundary making practices which differentially mark researcher+methods as "agencies of observation" and field as "objects of observation". Writes Barad: <br><br>
  <span class=quote>The notion of <i> intra-action</i> (in contrast to the usual 'interaction,' which presumes the prior existence of independent entities or relata) represents a profound conceptual shift. It is through specific agential intra-actions that the boundaries and properties of the components of phenomenon become determinate and that particular concepts (that is, particular material articulations of the world) become meaningful. Intra-actions include the larger material arrangement (i.e., set of material practices) that effects an agential cut between 'subject' and 'object' (in contrast to the more familiar Careisian cut which takes its distinction for granted). That is, the agential cut enacts a resolution within the phenomenon of the inherent ontological (and semantic) indeterminacy.  (2007, 139, emphasis in original)</span>
  <br><br>
  Citation cites int<i>er</i>action: the intellectual engagement of two presupposed human interlocutors who existed as independent entities before their encounter. Though there are different styles (e.g., APA, MLA, Chicago), the form of in-text citation accommodates only that which can fit between quotes and parentheses. How might one cite an idea formulated with an alleyway navigation? How might one cite interlocutors more than human while accounting for the apparatuses whereby human and nonhuman are differentially articulated? How might one cite empirical formations while remaining responsive to the entangled state of their existence?

    apparatuses are not assemblages of humans and nonhumans; they are open-ended practices involving specific intra-actions of humans and nonhumans, where the differential constitution of human and nonhuman designate particular phenomena that are themselves implicated in the dynamics of intra-activity, including their enfolding and reconstitution in the reconfiguring of apparatuses. That is, human bodies, alike all other bodies, are not entities with inherent boundaries and properties but phenomena that acquire specific boundaries and properties through the open-ended dynamics of intra-activity.

      Citation is an apparatus––a boundary making practice which performs an "agential cut" whereby interlocutors are rendered differentially intelligible within the phenomenon of an academic work. To reiterate from earlier, <i>how</i> we academics cite matters. I propose sitation as an alternative apparatus to citation, one which recognizes encounters as phenomena wherein interlocutors 'intra-actively' (Barad 2007) mark one another. Sitation assumes field and researcher to be provisional configurations where encounters' formal acknowledgement within an academic work renders their boundaries differentially determinate. Sitation sites 'intra-action' (Barad 2007).

<!--multiliteracies -->
<p>
  Integrated amidst the text of my thesis website, voice recordings taken while walking alleyways, videos of intersectional rhythms and sewing loops, screenshots of skyline sketches and more are all included “not as an aesthetic gesture” (McLucas 2000) but because “meaning expressed in one mode cannot be directly and completely translated into another” (Cope and Kalantzis 2009, 180). Differences in form matter. This understanding informed the New London Group, who first met in 1996 to develop a ‘pedagogy of multiliteracies’ that accounted for differences between and amongst languages in discourse, and the multiple forms of representation (Cope and Kalantzis 2009). Discussing multiliteracies a decade later, original members Bill Cope and Mary Kalantzis write "synaesthesia is integral to representation…Much of our everyday representational experience is intrinsically multimodal" (2009, 179). Navigating the city is a synaesthetic experience requiring the simultaneous apprehension and integration of multiple modes of information. Empirics from deep mapping emerge as inextricable layerings of sensorium, affect, and infrastructure through synesthetic attunement to the entangled viscera of urban bodies. 
  <br><br>
  Though offering but partial glimpses into an immersive practice, multimedia do provide a form of citation more responsive to different configurations empirics may take in a multimodal investigation. Sitation situates empirics within the practices by which they are produced. Sitation is still a boundary making practice. However, my hope is that it offers an alternative way to configure boundaries, making space for new possibilities that subvert established hegemonies through creative destruction<span style="color: #a88acf; "> [I know this is an economic geography term but I learned that only just now - do I cite both?]. </span>

  This is all to say I found it surprising that Mott and Cockayne (2017) made no mention of ableism in the academy. It may be that because their focus was on the practice of <i>who</i> we cite rather <i>how</i>, they did not consider the ways in which citational conventions are embedded in formal conventions that reproduce linear texts as the primarily legible research outputs. Or, how citational conventions serve as conversational norms, dictating acceptable ways of interacting and referencing interlocutors in an academic work. Institutionally established modes of knowledge production and form(at)s of rendering research privilege neurotypical cognitive styles, disabling ADHD graduate students like myself whose tactics of investigation are often at odds with academic norms of legibility and intelligibility. When neuronormative metrics of productivity determine what counts as valid and rigorous output, process-oriented research exceeds measure. Sitation ‘neuroqueers’ (Walker 2021) citation by interfering with neuronormative formats of acknowledgement, as well as the forms “intellectual engagement” and “interlocutors” may take. Sitation recognizes modes of knowledge production rendered illegible by citational conventions that reproduce linear text .pdfs as primary research outputs.

Crafting a multimodal thesis requires an eclectic methodologicalism––a toolkit of practical methods that are fit-for-purpose (Roberts 2018a). In both field research and site creation, I employ tactics of bricolage––the poetics of ‘making do’ with what tools, skills, and materials are readily available (Roberts 2018a). For example, instead of learning everything about coding and styling webpages before building my site, I teach myself what I need as I go, often gleaning (copypasting) snippets of open source code (as is custom) that are relevant to what I am attempting in the moment. Each page of my website is differently designed depending on the type of content I want to display. For instance, negative-spaces/rhythmanalysis.html contains a multitude of images, so I learned how to make image grids from W3Schools web tutorials (“How To Create an Image Grid” 2023). When constructing the .html documents, I even glean from myself, copypasting fragments of form from one page to perform a similar function on another. I also glean from practical knowledge of Cartesian cartography and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). I learned to use Github and git through my job at UBC Library where I where develop and lead workshops on GIS, as well as provide one on one consultations. In consults, I am often required to troubleshoot technical workflows. This requires not that I know everything beforehand, but that I know <i>how</i> to find information relevant to the question at hand. Whether giving consults, working as a Teaching Assistant, or making reference maps for scholarly publications, I exercise computational thinking. This is a skill I learned in a programming course for GIS. Computational thinking is a problem solving technique that was taught to me as follows: decomposition → pattern recognition → abstraction → algorithm. The point is to approach a problem by deconstructing it into component parts, recognizing similarities and connections, identifying and representing the gist of what needs to be done, and creating a plan to do it. I use computational thinking in the iterative formation of negative-spaces to tackle tasks like transcribing voice recordings, scanning books, and organizing the physical copies of all my literature. The algorithms, or workflows I’ve developed as needed have become tactics singular to my process of creation.

Candy (2006) differentiates practice-led and practice-based research as follows. In practice-led research, knowledge is generated <i>about</i> a practice, and the rendered product is primarily (if not all) text. In practice-based research, knowledge is generated <i>by means</i> of a creative practice, and the rendered product is both text and artistic artifact. My research resonates with some of, but not all the criteria of either category: deep mapping generates knowledge about a practice by means of that practice, and the rendered output is simultaneously, inextricably, text and artistic artifact. My research resonates with some of, but not all the criteria of either category: deep mapping generates knowledge about a practice by means of that practice, and the rendered output is simultaneously, inextricably, text and artistic artifact. Negative-spaces renders the effects of neither practice-led nor practice-based research, but research-creation. Research-creation outputs are ‘boundary objects’ for they satisfy certain disciplinary requirements without being disciplined (Loveless 2019, 32). She continues: 

<span class="quote">research-creation suggests a mode of knowledge production that does more than simply contribute to existing realms of interdisciplinary and disciplinary data. Instead, without eschewing the asymmetries of hierarchical disciplinary differences, it tumbles outside of these intellectual frameworks, challenging practice/theory divides as they police what gets to count as a valid object and method, within which disciplinary framework, where, when, and how."

The creation process is situated within the research activity and produces critically informed work in a variety of media (art forms). (Government of Canada 2012)</span>
    <br>
    Both the creation of my theory of deep mapping and the creation of negative-spaces (the critically informed work which renders it public) are situated <i>within and as part</i> of my research practice of deep mapping. Negative-spaces is a thus a research-creation output. While research-creation outputs take form in a variety of media, the textual component and artistic artifact(s) are understood to supplement one another; neither is more important. My thesis presents a special case for text and multimedia are integrated together.

    When I first reached out to the Public Scholarship Coordinator, he expressed enthusiasm as to my intended submission, assuring me the Faculty of Graduate in Postdoctoral Studies were there to support me in navigating the systemic formalities of reconfiguring cIRcle to archive my thesis submission, and not in the position of evaluating the validity (academic legibility) of my thesis form. However, during the July meeting with the Public Scholarship Coordinator and Associate Director of Student Academic Services, both repeatedly questioned how including a 3 to 5 page .pdf alongside my multimedia submission would "damage" the integrity of my work. They reiterated that the burdon of convincing the Faculty of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies otherwise was on me––that I would have to make a case for myself being an exception to convention, an argument for why my form mattered. Neither asked me about my theory or why I'd chosen this form, though I'd shared previously with the Public Scholarship Coordinator. "Despite completely being on your side," said the Public Scholarship Coordinator, "I personally am not convinced that this is good enough to say no to cIRcle" <span style="color: #a88acf; ">(Can I cite my meeting minutes/notes??)</span>. By "this" he was referring to the justifications I'd attempted to produce on the spot. I was not told what my argument would have to entail, who would be evaluating it, and how. It was only 15 minutes before the meeting that the Associate Director of Student Academic Services sent me a bullet list of six items necessary for theses including or consisting of a website. Written four hours after I proposed my research-creation to these representatives of UBC Faculty of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies, the mandate that primary thesis document will "always be a pdf file" serves to systemically subordinate my artistic artifact beneath a formally required textual .pdf component. <span style="color: #a88acf; ">[connection to research-creation and its being at odds at times within non MFA or arts focused programs.]</span>

    In her manifesto for research-creation, Natalie Loveless (2019) positions artistic form <i>as</i> method––a means of performatively challenging the hegemony of the monograph as only intelligible form of rendering graduate research public within academia. By being rendered an MA thesis by cIRcle, the institutional repository wherein it will be archived, negative-spaces performs the work of reconfiguring boundaries by showing up in the space of the intelligible as that which the established norm sought to delegitimize. Form becomes a tactic of interference, "elude[ing] discipline without being outside the field in which it is exercised…" (de Certeau 1984, 96).By interfering with hegemonic practices and processes of knowledge production, making space for deep mapping is an example of what GeoHumanities might do (Hawkins et al. 2015):

    Negative-spaces is not merely a set of reflections but a diffraction pattern marking the effects of an interference practice. By being the first website to be submitted and [speaking speculatively now] institutionally archived  as an MA thesis at UBC, negative spaces reconfigures boundaries in a way that matters. Not only does negative-spaces render a theory of deep mapping that is constituted through practice, it is itself enacting interference with hegemonic forms of representing place, producing geographic knowledge, and rendering spatial research public. Making space for deep mapping thus renders theory as praxis. It expands the field (Krauss 1979) from within by problematizing oppositional framings. It’s all the field for deep mapping.
