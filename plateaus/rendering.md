>"His elevation transfigures him into a voyeur... It puts him at a distance. It transforms the bewitching world by which one was "posessed" into a text that lies before one's eyes. It allows one to read it, to be a solar Eye, looking down like a god. The exaltation of a scopic and gnostic drive: the fiction of knowledge is related to this lust to be a viewpoint and nothing more....Escaping the imaginary totalizations produced by the eye, the everyday has a certain strangeness that does not surface, or whose surface is only the upper limit, outlining itself against the visible." (de certeau 1984, 92-93)  

>"Indeed, this "representation" is insufficient, precisely because a trajectory is drawn, and time and movement are thus reduced to a line that can be seized as a whole by the eye and read in a single moment, as one projects onto a map the path taken by someone walking through a city. However useful this "flattening out" may be, it transforms the temporal articulation of places into a spatial sequence of points. A graph takes the place of an operation. A reversible sign (one that can be read in both directions, once it is projected onto a map) is substituted for a practice indissociable from particular moments and "opportunities," and thus irreversible (one cannot go backward in time, or have another chance at missed oppor­ tunities). It is thus a mark in place of acts, a relic in place of perfor­ mances: it is only their remainder, the sign of their erasure. Such a projection postulates that it is possible to take the one (the mark) for the other (operations articulated on occasions)" (de certeau 35).

"Deep mapping... presupposed the embodied presence of the researcher 'within' the space under investigation" (Roberts 2018, 11).
    
>on *spacing*: "attention is on the contexts that humans render to space, along with the swirls of influences and affects in which we live, the other-than human and broader materiality; something fleshy with varying degrees of closure and open-ness over time." (Crouch 2017, 95)

(cartesian) maps render place by *reducing* the "fleshy," textural, and experiential to a flattened representation. 

```
How, then, might geographic knowledge generated through everyday spatial practices be rendered without being flattened, georeferenced, or vectorized?

## negative-spaces.github.io
his page introduces negative-spaces.github.io, the web-site and constitutive code repository which I will submit as my research-creation masters thesis. Taken together, this web-field-site will convey what I have learned thinking with the city in a rhizomatic form akin to the interconnectedness of physical and conceptual topoi (places) which lure me to disoriented discovery. In what follows, I articulate how my theorization of deep mapping––constituted through my practice of deep mapping––is enacted in both the form and formation of negative-spaces.github.io.

negative-spaces.github.io is itself a webbed field for deep mapping, a space for nonlinear exploration following ideas that grasp and pull the visitor. Until now, I have used this address to invoke the entire site. However, pasting this link into a web browser will bring you to an initial entry point only. My argument will unfold across multiple pages, each page connecting to a multiplicity of others via hyperlinks. SHOW Multimedia, rather than being relegated to an appendix, are integrated directly with text. My use of Github as a host platform was inspired by sultanazana.github.io, whose “network of webpages will grow more tangled with time.” Conventionally used for managing code development, I chose Github as a host platform because the code repository renders visible the iterative process of my site’s formation as well as the content which constitutes its rendered form. 

I know how to make web maps, wield GIS, and construct cartesian cartographies. What I didn’t know a year ago was how I would render a geography in process and of process without tracing out my practice in a linear text.pdf. Tactics are methods whose validity is measured by their applicability to the situation at hand (de Certeau 1984). Appropriate use of tactics therefore depends on practical, experiential knowledge gleaned through everyday navigations of terrains physical, conceptual, and digital. 

In both field-research and site-creation I employ tactics of bricolage––the poetics of making do with what tools, skills, and materials are already around (Roberts 2018a). For example, instead of learning everything about coding and styling webpages before building my web-site, I teach myself what I need as I go, often gleaning (copypasting) snippets of open source code (as is custom) that are relevant to what I am attempting in the moment. Moreover, I picked up knowledge of git and Github through my job in GIS at the university library. Mapping deeply cultivates an awareness of what is around, gleaning information that may become useful later on.

Site form and formation - ATP - elaborate end of aag paper

"Research-creation follows desire, and builds spaces and contexts that allow the time and space
        to experiment in unpredictable directions. " (Loveless 2019, 70)

Research-creation outputs as 'boundary objects' (Bowker and Star 1999)
            "A boundary object does things with disciplines, satisfying certain of their requirements, without, however, belonging properly to any one of them" (32)

## Rendering Spatial Research Public 

I recently connected with my university’s public scholarship coordinator because as it stands, MA theses must be formatted as linear PDFs in order to be submitted to cIRcle,  the platform contracted to publish graduate research. As a result of our conversation, I will work together with the logistics team as they re-code the system to make space to upload and archive my web-field-site. 
This means the site which renders my theory of deep mapping as interference with systemic norms of research intelligibility and legibility will serve also as a tactic for interference within and as part of the system. In ways that continue to surprise me, making space for deep mapping enacts deep mapping as praxis.
