  <p>
    <span style="font-weight:700">WAVES</span><br>
    Waves are all around in the form of water, sound vibrations, and electromagnetic radiation. Water and sound waves require a medium to move through, such as liquid or air. Electromagnetic waves, on the other hand, do not. The sun emits electromagnetic waves that radiate through the vacuum of space. Visible light, responsible for the colors humans can see, comprises only a portion of electromagnetic radiation on the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum.  Radiation on the EM spectrum, ranging from longest wavelength to shortest, proceeds as follows: radio waves, microwave, infrared, visible, ultraviolet, X-ray, Gamma ray. A microwave appliance heats your food in minutes or less by radiating microwaves––whose wavelength is 100,000 times shorter than a radio waves, yet still 20,000 times greater than visible-to-humans light––into the food, exciting its molecules whose vibration results in heat. The spectrum of visible-to-human light ranges from red, whose wavelength is the longest, to violet, whose wavelength is the shortest. Though bees cannot see red, they can see ultraviolet light (Shipman 2011) which is just beyond the violet perceptible to humans. Infrared radiation, whose wavelength is just longer than visible red, may be felt as heat. Infrared sensors are used for thermal imaging, night-vision apparatuses, and studying cloud structure among other things (National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Science Mission Directorate 2010a, 2010b). A portion of the sun's incoming solar radiation is reflected by the earth as infrared. Remote sensors on satellites collect data on reflected near-infrared waves which, as I once did in a remote sensing course, can be processed by specific software to assess vegetation cover and crop health (National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Science Mission Directorate 2010b). In highschool, I had a wonderful environmental science teacher who explained how scientists can tell whether a star is moving towards us or away from us by the color of light it appears to be emitting. Similar to the Doppler effect characteristic of siren wails, when a star is moving towards us/Earth/the instrument of investigation, the electromagnetic radiation it is emitting becomes "scrunched up" in front of it, decreasing the wavelengths so that the visible light being emitted appears blue to the human eye. This is known as blueshift. On the other hand, when a star is moving away from us/Earth/the instrument of investigation, the electromagnetic radiation behind it becomes more and more "stretched out" and so what visible light is being emitted appears red to the human eye. This is known as redshift. In biology the following year I learned that plant leaves look green because in the process of photosynthesis, where sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide are transformed into sugar and oxygen within plant cells, the wavelengths responsible for the visible colors red and blue are absorbed whilst those for green and yellow-green are reflected. This is all to say waves are ambient, effecting what you see, feel, and hear in encounter sensing/sensory apparatuses.

    When two or more waves occupy the same space in time they are said to be <span style="font-weight:500">superpositioned</span>. Superpositioned waves do not oppose one another but interfere, their displacements combining to produce a new wave. Constructive interference occurs when superpositioned waves are in phase with one another, meaning the crests and troughs of all waves align. Destructive interference occurs when superpositioned waves are out of phase, when crests from one wave align with troughs of another for example. The patterning of interference is called a <span style="font-weight:500">diffraction pattern</span>. Particles occupy distinct positions in time and space; two particles cannot be in the same place at once. Thus, particles cannot produce diffraction patterns. Only waves can produce diffraction patterns because only waves can be superpositioned.

      Sometime in early pandemic quarantine, I performed a diffraction experiment of my own in a pitch-black bathroom for my undergraduate physics course. Using a laser pointer, I sent a beam of light through a piece of tinfoil with two razor-thin slits, both vertical and parallel to one another. On the wall beyond, a pattern of alternating bright and dark stripes appeared. I have recreated the set-up and detailed the experiment below.

      <p>
        <br>
        Passing through the tinfoil, the laster beam is bifurcated by the double slit and spreads out as it emanates from both openings. What is rendered visible on the wall beyond is a diffraction pattern marking the effects of the interference of these two waves of light. The bright stripes on the wall mark where constructive interference occurred, constituting a new wave whose heightened amplitudes effect a brighter light. The dark stripes mark the effect of destructive interference, where superpositioned waves were out of phase, effectively canceling each other out to produce a flatline - no light at all. The observation of bright and dark stripes - kindly captured in my recreation by an interlocutor - was worth the postage required to ship DIY kits across the country to quarantined undergraduate students because it illuminated light behaving as a wave. Why is this so fascinating? Did I not begin this page talking about lightwaves? Well, light can <i>also</i> behave as a (subatomic) particle: a photon. A photon is a discreet physical quantity, or quantum, of the electromagnetic field; a photon is a quantum of light (Barad 2015, 395). However, while light may behave as both wave and particle, it cannot be apprehended as both at once. That is to say, wave and particle are <i>entangled states</i>. Now this entanglement isn't only characteristic of light. Experiments have shown that matter, for instance the negatively-charged subatomic particle called electrons, will produce a diffraction pattern under certain circumstances (Barad 2007, 83). The first double-slit diffraction experiment was conducted by Thomas Young in 1801, and the investigative setup has since been employed to explore such quantum entanglements as the wave-particle duality of matter. With this page, I introduce diffraction as a way to figure what is rendered of an interference practice such as deep mapping. I offer my first iteration at a theory of deep mapping, and situate my subsequent and current theorization within the frameworks my thinking and practice have been iteratively diffracted through. Because I have limited space and time - constrained as I am by the length and requirements of this degree project - this page serves as an account of initial patternings of interest.

    Deep mapping disorients representationalist dualisms by assuming the field of encounter as interlocutor. In both deep mapping (practice) and making space for deep mapping (rendering), I aim to produce ‘situated knowledges’ wherein the object of knowledge is engaged as actor and agent (Haraway 1988, 592). Yet objects are not preexisting entities but “boundary projects” whose “boundaries are drawn by mapping practices” (Haraway 1988, 595). Recall the cartography assignment introduced in <a href="./disorientation.html">disorientation.html</a>. Not only did tracing a map stand <i>in place</i> of spatial practice, the traced map stood in place of the map making practices which constituted it. The course assignment recommended a source statement of “Google Maps”, effectively erasing the illustration software with which the map was created, the computers on which the software ran, the internet connection and browsers which rendered Google Maps visible to screenshot, the lab instructions, my own directives and acquired technical expertise as course TA… in short, the entire material arrangement of the map’s production. Thus, the assignment irresponsibly reproduced a “gaze from nowhere” (Haraway 1988, 581) whereby the producers of geographic knowledge (in this case, the mappers) remained unimplicated in, and therefore unaccountable to, the boundary drawing practices entailed in rendering an object of knowledge (in this case, a place). Boundary drawing practices in this example are those involved physically tracing a map of downtown, choosing which streets to include and exclude, how to crop the frame, which names to label with and which (land) acknowledgements to leave out. Additionally, boundary making practices in the construction of this assignment included those that differentiated the mapper as the thinking subject from Google's map of downtown Vancouver as the inert object to be mapped, as well as those that cited between the mapper as 'map author' as actor and agent while rendering invisible the skills, software, and tools with which the map was produced. I am partially responsible for the lack of situated knowledge, for I provided instruction during the lab sessions. While I did not write the lab assignments, in my 2nd and 3rd semester TAing the course I did write rubrics where none had existed before. However, I knew not then what I know now; Indeed, my first semester TAing cartography came mere months after I made my first reference map, having taught myself Adobe Illustrator from the back of an old schoolbus while working as a hemp farmer in Oregon.

    In a shift away from geometric optics' visual metaphors that privilege a “fixed position”, Donna Haraway (1991, 70) suggests diffraction. She writes, “diffraction is a mapping of interference, not of replica­tion, reflection, or reproduction. A diffraction pattern does not map where differences appear, but rather maps where the <i>effects</i> of difference appear” (Haraway 1991, 70, emphasis in original). Encountering the effects of interference actually led to my first iteration at a theory of deep mapping. The following is from January 2022, my first winter in Vancouver.

      Some grey day I walked the stretch of shoreline that wraps around the University of British Columbia. With the Salish Sea on one side and a forest of evergreens and sword ferns to the other, campus is geographically and administratively separated from the City of Vancouver. It also occupies the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam) people. A five minute walk from the Geography Department takes me to a zig-zag staircase at the bottom of which awaits a place where clothing is optional. My shoes and socks are the first to come off. The sand is cold and firm, yet porous. It holds the impression of my soles and reshapes in my hands. I contain it for a moment, appreciating its texture, then let it go. 
      <br><br>
      Sunshine was a precious thing my first winter in Vancouver when it rained for four months straight. The cloud cover was so dense that a dimple of white was the only indication our star remained. Monochrome days used to really kill my vibe. There is a dullness to a landscape lit ambiently, a non-differentiation that makes it difficult to articulate thoughts. That day I paused at ocean’s edge where barnacles encrust the rocks and molluscs cling together in crunchy bundles. In and out rolled the waves, and I breathed with them. On each exhale I noticed how foam gathered around the rocks at my feet, forming bubbles on whose surface spun psychedelic spirals.

      This happens due to thin film interference, where light waves reflecting off the surface of a bubble overlap with waves which have been transmitted through the film, reflected back, and refracted at the surface at the angle of incidence. When refracted waves are shifted so as to be in-synch with those reflected, they interfere constructively to make visible an abundance of colors (Cogverse Academy 2016). Deep mapping is constructive interference with the superficial reflection that is place rendered (down from above) by flat maps. Mapping deeply requires entering the landscape––putting one’s self into the field––and emerging to render a cartography beyond the monochrome.

  <p>While walking False Creek that winter, I shared this idea with an interlocutor who recommended I read the above Haraway (1991) on diffraction. The limitation of geometric optics and its attendant reflections is further elaborated by Karen Barad (2003; 2007), who explains how diffraction can only be understood using physical optics. Importantly, whereas geometric optics relies on classical (Newtownian) physics, physical optics are explained using quantum physics. Unlike classical physics, quantum physics allows for superpositions, for entangled states. What is needed to produce 'situated knowledges' (Haraway 1988) (of the place one inhabits) is not reflexivity on the part of the researcher, or merely an approach which <i>counters</i> the hegemonic one, but an account of <i>how</i>differences come to matter as the effect of boundary making practices. 
    </p>

    <p>
      In <i>Meeting the Universe Halfway: Quantum Physics and the Entanglement of Matter and Meaning</i> (2007), Barad attends to this by "building diffractive apparatuses to study the entangled effects differences make" (73). While not involving a laser pointer and tinfoil in a dark room, Barad's diffractive apparatuses are every bit as effective for generating diffractive phenomena. After reading Haraway on diffraction, I was googling for more writing coming from the humanities and social sciences on the matter when I encountered Barad's opus. <i>Meeting the Universe Halfway</i> gave me a language to think about what it meant to theorize and practice everyday urban geography from <i>within and as part of</i> a city. I am thus beholden to this account my theory and praxis are so diffracted through. 
      </p>
      
      <p>Barad (2007) conducts a close reading of Niels Bohr's philosophy-physics to illuminate Bohr's complementarity relation as explanation for quantum entanglements, particularly the wave-particle duality of matter. According to Bohr, properties are indeterminate prior to their measurement. That is, position and momentum, properties of particles and waves respectively, are indeterminate prior to their measurement. It is not that they are uncertain––that they exist but remain unknown due to the act of measurement effecting the recorded value, as Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle would have it––but that they do not exist to be known before the act of measurement. Barad underlines this as a shift from epistemic (uncertainty as a matter of knowing) to ontic (indeterminacy as a matter of being) (Barad 2007, 118 and 127). Reading the writing of Niels Bohr and Michel Foucault through one another, Barad defines apparatuses as ongoing and open-ended material-discursive boundary making practices which resolve the indeterminacy of a property by performing an "agential cut" whereby the "agencies of observation" and "object of observation" are differentially articulated. "Agencies of observation" and "object of observation" are provisional configurations––entangled states which "intra-actively" mark  one another within and as part of phenomena. Their use of the term 'intra-action' is of specific consequence:  
      <br><br>
        <!--Barad intra action quote-->
        <span class="quote">
          The notion of <i>intra-action</i> (in contrast to the usual 'interaction,' which presumes the prior existence of independent entities or relata) represents a profound conceptual shift. It is through specific agential intra-actions that the boundaries and properties of the components of phenomenon become determinate and that particular concepts (that is, particular material articulations of the world) become meaningful. Intra-actions include the larger material arrangement (i.e., set of material practices) that effects an agential cut between 'subject' and 'object' (in contrast to the more familiar Cartesian cut which takes its distinction for granted). That is, the agential cut enacts a resolution within the phenomenon of the inherent ontological (and semantic) indeterminacy. In other words, relata do not preexist relations; rather, relata-within-phenomena emerge through specific intra-actions. Crucially, then, intra-actions enact agential <i> separability</i>––the condition of <i>exteriority-within-phenomena</i> (Barad 2007, 139-140, emphasis in original)
        </span>
        <br>
        Within the double-slit diffraction experiment recreated above, myself, equipped with practical knowledge of the experimental setup and interpretation, the dark room and smooth walls, as well as the laser, camera and person taking photograph, tinfoil, Exacto knife, and binder clamps are marked as "agencies of observation" by the boundary making practice, or apparatus, through which the diffraction pattern is produced as an "object of observation". This distinction also presumes definite boundaries to all these measuring agencies, eliding the apparatuses responsible for <i>their</i> mattering. If memory serves, my undergraduate double-slit diffraction assignment required me to calculate the wavelength of the laser beam using the distance between the two slits, the distance between the tinfoil and the middle bright stripe on the wall, and the distances between the bright stripes, also known as fringes. A ruler and calculator, then, as well as an equation and practical knowledge solving trigonometric functions, were additional agencies of observation. 
        </p>

        <p>
          But how are we to understand measurements? According to Barad's agential realism, "<i>measured properties refer to phenomena</i>…" (Barad 2007, 197, emphasis in original). Wave and particle are therefore phenomena within which momentum and position are made differentially determinate through apparatuses that constitute the mutually exclusive conditions for either property to become intelligible. What becomes intelligible is not an innocent matter, however, for the constitution of a determinate form entails the exclusion of all other/ed possible configurations. In other words, matter cannot be apprehended as both wave and particle at once. Objectivity, Barad avers, is not gained from a distanced position but from the agential separability enacted by intra-actions. That is, the agential cut performed by an apparatus differentiates agencies of observation and object of observation, thereby producing the condition of exteriority within a phenomenon. It is through the exteriority <i>within</i> phenomena that a casual structure emerges where 'measuring agencies' ('effect') may be understood to be marked by the 'measured object' ('cause') (Barad 2007, 337-340). In other words, "<i>measurement is the intra-active marking of one part of a phenomenon by another</i>" (Barad 2007, 388, emphasis in original). The measurement of wavelength thus describes an intra-action between agencies and object of observation (described above) within and as part of the wave phenomenon. Because "measured values can be unambiguously and contingently attributed to the corresponding property of "objects-in-the-phenomenon" (not to some presumably independent object)" (Barad 2007, 465), the recorded wavelength marks objective data if and only if its referent is the wave phenomenon. Diffraction is therefore not a metaphor for Barad. For them, diffraction patterns mark the effects of <span style="font-weight:400">diff</span>erential int<span style="font-weight:400">ra-actions</span>. Diffraction patterns are marks on bodies, where what comes to matter is the result of boundary making practices, or apparatuses, which differentially articulate the world. In an agential realist account, "objectivity is a matter of accountability to marks on bodies…. Accountability to marks on bodies requires an accounting of the apparatuses that enact determinate causal structures, boundaries, properties, and meanings" (Barad 2007, 340). How might a source statement for the cartography assignment I taught be refigured so as to render the map an objective account of the city?

    <span style="font-weight:700">TRACING AS PLACING</span><br>
    That maps do not offer inherently objective representations of place will come as no surprise to those versed in critical cartography. Critical cartography is summarized by Crampton and Krygier (2006) as 1. the theoretical critique of cartography and 2. those maps that critique. Critique is not criticism, but rather the critical examination of an ontology’s evolution and assumptions with the aim of offering alternative possibilities (Crampton and Krygier 2006, 6). Examination of cartography reveals the following: maps are not neutral. Geographic knowledge is inseparable from power, and thus, the political (Crampton and Krygier 2006). I want to shift focus for now from (the very necessary and important) discussion of <i>what</i> is included and excluded by a given map to <i>how</i> different articulations of the world come to matter. More specifically, I am interested in the boundary making practices, or apparatuses, involved in different forms of engaging place, producing geographic knowledge, rendering spatial research. Accounting for apparatuses is important in order to remain responsive to <i>how</i> some bodiesstories become privileged as legible subjects or intelligible formations  while others are "excluded from mattering" (Barad 2007, 220).
    </p>
  <p>
    Thinking back to the course assignment's directive "your source is Google Maps", I wonder what specifically is being attributed to Google Maps? Note that the assignment required students to include a symbol representing BC Place, a stadium downtown, as well as a couple other points of interest. Therefore, Google Maps was not only referenced to trace land and water, streets and their names, but location as well. If we understand the objectivity of empirical formations to be contingent on accounting for the apparatuses by which they are constituted, then an account of how position is made determinate withinby Google Maps seems warranted. Google Maps is an example of the visualizing technologies which perform "the god trick of seeing everything from nowhere" (Haraway 1988, 581). It provides the mapper interactive access to a 2-dimensional Cartesian representation of the earth's surface. The property of position is made intelligible within the Cartesian framework by a coordinate pair, where every point on earth is marked by a unique latitude and longitude. However, the location of a coordinate (measured value of position) on Google Maps is determined by the coordinate reference system used. Let me clarify with a brief description for workshop I recently developed on georeferencing historical maps (Demet 2024):

      Making Cartesian maps requires some method for flattening out the earth so we can represent it on our 2-dimensional computer screens. A Coordinate Reference System (CRS) defines this transformation. A CRS contains two components: a datum and a coordinate system.
      <br><br>
      <span style="font-weight:500">Datums</span><br>
      Earth is not a perfect sphere but rather a spheroid as it is flattened slightly at the poles. Ellipsoid, referencing a 3-dimensional ellipse, describes the same shape. From Esri’s (2021) description: “While a spheroid approximates the shape of the earth, a datum defines the position of the spheroid relative to the center of the earth. A datum provides a frame of reference for measuring locations on the surface of the earth. It defines the origin and orientation of latitude and longitude lines.” A geocentric datum positions the center of the spheroid, aka ellipsoid, at the earth’s center of mass. A local datum “aligns its spheroid to closely fit the earth’s surface in a particular area.”

      Datums are developed using satellite data. A geocentric datums is useful when a map is meant to show the whole earth, such as a World Map or Open Street Maps’ web map. Local datums are useful when the area of interest is confined to a continent such as North America or a single country. Because local datums are accurate precisely for the area of their ellipsoid’s best fit, it would be unwise to use a local datum for a global map, or a datum specific to North America for Africa. Datums are named by their extent and survey year. Today, the most common geocentric datum is WGS 84 (World Geodetic System 1984), and the most common local datum for the United States and Canada is NAD 83 (North American Datum 1983).

      A coordinate system is the math governing the projection of points on an ellipsoid to a 2-dimensional plane. A coordinate system is either a Projected Coordinate system (PCS) or Geographic Coordinate system (GCS)....geographic coordinate systems plot points in decimal degrees, whereas the unit for projected coordinate systems is meters.

    To visually illustrate an example, I have put together a video below. I demonstrate how the location of a Tim Hortons on Google Maps is contingent on the coordinate reference system used. First, I copy Google Maps' measurement of the position of the Tim Hortons. The Latitude is 49.26384702 decimal degrees and the longitude is -123.140715 decimal degrees. I then paste this coordinate pair into an excel spreadsheet, separating lat and long into horizontal cells and labeling them above lat and long. Finally, I open QGIS, an open source geographic information system (GIS) for analyzing, manipulating, and visualizing geographic information. Explains the QGIS user guide: "Just as we use a word processor to write documents and deal with words on a computer, we can use a GIS application to deal with spatial information on a computer" (“A Gentle Introduction to GIS” 2024, emphasis in original). First, I add Google Maps as a basemap. This is essentially the same map that can be engaged in an internet browser.  Then, I added to my QGIS project the coordinate for Tim Hortons. As you will see, it is located directly on the Tim Hortons marker identified by Google Maps. This is because I am essentially matching the point located on Google Maps' web map to that same map loaded in the QGIS environment. In both cases, Google Maps has the same coordinate reference system, so a point located on one will map to the same position on the other. But what happens if I change the coordinate reference system of my Tim Hortons data point while leaving my Google Maps basemap in its original one? Take a moment to watch and listen to the video below. I made this video by screen recording while recording my voice on my phone. I emailed the audio recording to myself and then combined the audio and video recordings on iMovie. I uploaded the resulting video to YouTube because the file was too large to commit to my Github repository.

    The position of a particular Tim Hortons near my home is first made determinate through my intra-action with Google Maps. So long as the point shares the coordinate reference system of Google Maps, it will be superimposed upon the Tim Hortons as rendered by the Google Maps in QGIS. However, when I change the coordinate reference system of the point [49.26384702, -123.140715], Google Maps no longer locates it on the Tim Hortons. Although the measured value of position remains the same, the value is made determinate as a different location by a different coordinate reference system. The meaning of position in Cartesian representations of the world is therefore entangled with the coordinate reference system by which it is itself rendered intelligible. Locations on Cartesian maps are phenomena. The construction of situated objectivity in Cartesian cartography requires reference to the coordinate reference system used. Although the course assignment did not concern students with coordinate points, tracing the points, lines, and polygons of Google Maps is the citation of a particular coordinate reference system  and re-presentation of a specific phenomenon. something about marks on bodies??? Questions emerging as I continued to teach and practice cartography while deep mapping included: How is downtown produced as a place through the act of tracing a 'top-down' Cartesian representation of the city? How is place produced as such through the act of tracing? What is the relationship between a place as rendered by a tracing and that which is experienced and/or constituted by the everyday spatial practices of urban inhabitants? In future research, I will attend more thoroughly to the corpus of writing by geographers differentiating space and place. Throughout this project, however, my thinking on the matter has been most influenced by Michel de Certeau (1984). And so, I bracket a literature review in favor of exploring how de Certeau's figuration of space and place might nuance the above questions.

    Google’s map of Vancouver abides by the law of the “proper”. It produces the city as a place wherein each element has a distinct location. Position is made determinate by a spatial configuration which “excludes the possibility of two things being in the same location (<i>place</i>)” (de Certeau 1984, 117, emphasis in original). Such a static coordination allows for navigation to be routed (by Google) from one element to another. The navigational possibilities, however, remain determined (and constrained) by the law whose logic governs the map: follow streets, not alleys; walk on sidewalks; don’t jay-walk; turn right here, not at the next block. Disorientation is a destination not found by Google Maps, which asks in response, "Should this place be on Google Maps?"  (“Google Maps” n.d.).

    Yet de Certeau contends it is pedestrian movements that spatialize the city, writing, “space is composed of intersections of mobile elements…space occurs as the effect produced by the operations that orient it, situate it, temporalize it…” (1984, 117). While urban geographers and planners may theorize and design the city, urban space is produced through everyday navigations and encounters. If the apprehension of place renders position determinate, the motion that spatializes renders position indeterminate: “to walk is to lack a place” (de Certeau 1984, 103). Google Maps imposes the law of the “proper” upon navigation by substituting “a mark in place of acts, a relic in place of performances: it is only their remainder, the sign of their erasure” (de Certeau 1984, 35, emphasis in original). The relationship between place and space seems entangled with that between trace and practice. In <a href="./practice.html">negative-spaces/practice.html</a> I introduced the iterative spatial practices of eurythmy and form drawing I grew up practicing as part of Waldorf education. Each week, beginning in first grade, we would sit for an hour in silence drawing a single form over and over, our crayon in constant contact with the page. Writes form drawing teacher Rosemary Gerbert, "a form drawing is a present record of a past movement, the remaining trace of a finished gesture." (1987, 9). Tracing is a practice of (spatial) citation. Tracing is still practice. It is the trace which, framed as the output, marks the effects of an interference practice and so renders the practice by which it was constituted unintelligible. Places, like objects of knowledge, are not preexisting entities but “boundary projects" (Haraway 1988, 595) drawn into being by boundary making practices such as tracing. If space, time and matter are phenomena (Barad 2007), place is as well. Place is a phenomenon within which position may take on determinate values whose measurements which refer to situated locations rendered intelligible within and as part of phenomena. The source of the map produced through the cartography assignment I TAed was not Google Maps' aerial view of the city, but the practices of tracing and exclusion which constituted downtown as an object of observation. Objectivity requires reference be made not (only) of Google Maps but the placing phenomenon within which downtown Vancouver emerges as an object of knowledge.

    We live in a moment where locative technology is ubiquitous. Becoming lost no longer requires going out of one's way. Instead, "disoriented discovery" (Kurgan 2013) begins with a choice to not reference Google Maps, to turn location off and allow position to remain indeterminate. Reading Barad (2007) and de Certeau (1984) through one another, I believe place and space to be phenomenal expressions of the world differentially articulated through trace and practice. I am particularly interested in how pedestrian tracings of Google Maps––a locative technology which renders the city down from above as a place––inform everyday navigations and thus the production of urban space. How does Google Maps define intra-actions between humans and urban infrastructure, becoming part of dialogue with the urban surround it both enables and constrains? How are categories like human|nonhuman or field|researcher performatively constituted through embodied methodologies and sensory, more-than-human, and imaginative (Elliott and Culhane 2017) ethnographies? I wonder how posthuman embodiment might inform mapping practices in ways that reconfigure delimitations presumed by Google Maps. It is to these last questions I now turn my attention.

    My fieldsite cannot be instantaneously apprehended as the nominal City, nor can it be captured by the frame of a single map. Neither has one disciplinary framework or methodology been sufficient to think through practice: each time I leave home I bring along an assortment of people/stories/theories I wish to think with for the day. I put them into conversation first amongst themselves. Heavy in my bag, their pages interlap, folding together like a pair of hands. Opening one, I open myself: Read me.

    Barad employs what they describe as a diffractive methodology to "think[] insights from different disciplines (and interdisciplinary approaches) through one another" (2007, 93). A diffractive methodology differs from a diffractive apparatus, for, as articulated above, apparatuses are boundary making practices not experimental setups, methods, tactics, or otherwise agencies of observation. Indeed, apparatuses are the very practices responsible for differentially articulating the agencies of observation and the object of observation within a phenomenon. Diffraction phenomena are at times the object of investigation, at other times, the apparatus of investigation, though never both at once (Barad 2007, 73). I understand engaging a diffractive methodology to be the negotiation of this entanglement––an exploration through the iterative interplay of generating interferences and studying diffraction patterns to understand how differences come to matter. 
    </p>

    <p>Diffractive reading is about reading <i>through</i> rather than against: interference rather than opposition, diffraction rather than reflection. "Diffractive readings bring inventive provocations;" says Barad in an interview, "they are good to think with" (Barad qtd in van der Tuin and Dolphijn 2012). Drawing from Barad and Haraway, Murris and Bozalek (2019) develop propositions for guiding diffractive readings of literature. What I find most admirable is that they do so by putting Barad's diffractive methodology into practice. Their article marks the effects of their diffractive reading of 1. propositions generated through another exercise in diffractive reading, and 2. their article itself. Thus, in the process of formation, their article serves as a diffractive apparatus for generating interferences while what's rendered through publication is a diffraction pattern marking the effects of their interference practice. They write:   <br><br>
    <span class="quote">
      The challenge in adopting diffraction as a methodology is not to <i>theorise</i> the diffraction pattern (a logic of representation), but to put it into <i>practice</i>, thereby disrupting the theory/practice binary. The idea is to read theory <i>with</i> practice diffractively guided by, for example, key questions that move the experiment forward. (Murris and Bozalek 2019, 1505, emphasis in original)

    This is what I have attempted to do in my master's research-creation by theorizing deep mapping through practicing deep mapping and enacting my theory as praxis in ongoing iteration as I continue to engage with the physical-conceptual fields of my encounter. I encountered Haraway (1991) and then Barad (2003, 2007, 2012, 2015) a few months after my first theorization of deep mapping as constructive interference. My thinking diffracted through agential realism, I refigured my theory of deep mapping from constructive interference to interference in general (both constructive and destructive), for superpositioned positionalities need not be aligned nor must their interference amplify their intensity. Writing this page in particular has urged me to think more deeply about what it might mean to ask the question, 'What could it mean to think <i>with</i> place and <i>feel</i> the city?' As Natalie Loveless (2019) writes in her manifesto for research-creation "<i>the crafting of a research question is the crafting of a story that is also the crafting of an ethics</i>" (95, emphasis in original). The framing of a question is a boundary drawing practice which shapes the field of possible responses. Like any other page of my thesis (and my thesis itself), I did not know how what this page would be about besides interference. However, I <i>was</i> sure that the process of configuring negative-spaces/interference.html was the only way to find out. Writing this page has been a difficult practice, the effects of which are only just becoming articulate. I am finding the writing at this point to help me think through my research question.

    My research-creation asked, <span  style="background-color: #82ffd562">'What could it mean to think <i>with</i> place? to <i>feel</i> the city?'</span> 
  </p>

  <p>Responding to this question requires an exploration of what it might mean to think, to think <i>with</i>, to feel, as well as the boundary making practices involved in citing place and the city as interlocutors. Rather than offer an authoritative definition, I diffract these questions (and by extension my initial question) through some of what I've encountered of the physical-conceptual field so far. My goal of my thesis project was never to answer my question, but rather to explore and respond through deep mapping. Thus, my exploration and response to my research question and its attendant questions has been and continue to be diffracted through my simultaneous exploration and response to the question, 'What is deep mapping?' 
</p>

<p>
  Recall my first theorization of deep mapping, formulated by thinking with the diffraction phenomena of thin film interference<br><br>
  <span class="quote">
    Deep mapping is constructive interference with the superficial reflection that is place rendered (down from above) by flat maps. Mapping deeply requires entering the landscape––putting one’s self into the field––and emerging to render a cartography beyond the monochrome.
  </span>
  <br>
  What I was gesturing towards was how deep mapping was for me an interference practice, rather than one of opposition or intervention. It was in this sense that I became cautious of describing deep mapping as counter cartography, for it did not seem to <i>counter</i> cartography so much as describe a practice aimed at articulating alternate possible spatial stories through interfering with those defined by generalized abstractions. While I recognized deep mapping could not occur from a remove, I <i>did</i> assume a preexisting exterior to "the field" from which one stepped "into" and then "emerged". Such an initial conceptualization is unsurprising given the literature through which I came upon deep mapping. My first introduction to deep mapping was Les Roberts' work which I encountered in 2020 during my undergraduate thesis research on critical and creative cartographies. This was at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic had recently shuttered my undergraduate campus, forcing me into isolation in rural Maine. Roberts editorials (2016a, 2018a) for his two <i>Humanities</i> special issues were the first creative scholarly publications I ever read. Immersed as I was in physical geography and geographic information science, deep mapping and the concept of spatial bricolage (see <a href="./tactics.html" target="_blank">negative-spaces/tactics.html</a>) seemed to offer just the open-ended and expressive form of fieldwork I yearned for. When the world as mediated through my phone became increasingly unintelligible, wandering the woods made more and more sense. I began leaving familiar pathways and cultivating spatial awareness by landmarks such as uprooted trees, wetlands, and boulders. I attended to alternate perceptual scales, kneeling to observe trumpet lichen pushing up from rotting trees and listen for water gurgling underground in spring (Demet 2021). Roberts (2016b) calls deep mapping "an embodied and reflexive immersion in a life that is lived and performed spatially. A cartography of depth. A <i>diving within</i>" (XIV, emphasis in original). Deep mapping, he elaborates in a subsequent publication, "presupposes the embodied presence of the researcher 'within' the space under investigation" (Roberts 2018x, 11). Reflexivity is central to Roberts' formulation of deep mapping, which presupposes the human body as differentiated from the nonhuman, and which will have embodied experiences upon which to reflect. Roberts understands "space as a symbolically expressive and embodied engagement with the everyday world(s) we inhabit and pass through. Space as a constitutive component of everyday being. Space as lived. Life as <i>spaced</i>" (2018a, 28). David Crouch (2003) compares notions of embodied practice with those of performance and performativity to explore how identity is constituted through encounters with space. Crouch develops 'spacing' as a term which "identifies subjective and practical ways in which the individual handles his or her material surroundings. Spacing is positioned in terms of action, making sense (including the refiguring of 'given' space), and mechanisms of opening up possibilities" (Crouch 2003, 1945). For Crouch (2003), as for Roberts (2016b, 2018a), the human is already differentiated from their nonhuman, material surroundings which they make sense of through an <i>embodied</i> positionality. For both, space is nebulous, constituted as something an individual can be "'within'" or that which is "'given'", but also something lived, performed, and open to reconfiguring. Discussing vitalist geographies, Beth Greenhough (2011, 41) says "space and time are brought into being simultaneously with the actualisation of a given phenomenon." This may seem to echo Barad (2007) for whom space, time and matter are phenomena (316) and "mutually constituted through the dynamics of iterative intra-activity" (181). "There is a vitality to the liveliness of intra-activity," Writes Barad, "not in the sense of a new form of vitalism, but rather in terms of a new sense of aliveness" (2007, 177). I am not as yet well versed in non-representational theory or more-than-human geography, so cannot make generalized statements about vitalist geographies. What I can do is mark the stark distinction in how agency is figured and the human|nonhuman differentially constituted by agential realism's posthuman performativity and vitalist geographies as discussed in this specific paper. 
</p>


<p>
  For Greenhough, the vitalism of vitalist geographies extends "agency (the power to sense the world)...to all living beings" (2011, 41). What constitutes lively beings is never articulated, however; the boundary drawing practices by which life is differentiated from the nonliving and human bodies from those nonhuman remains unaccounted for. If sense is the capacity of living beings (Greenhough 2011), then the promiscuity of physical and virtual subatomic particles and the desire with which they reach out towards one another (Barad 2012, 2015) can be adduced to illustrate how all matter is vital. Agency in agential realism is not ascribed based on 'sense,' 'living,' and 'being' for such properties are themselves constituted through intra-activity and therefore cannot be inherent to an already individuated part of the word. Writes Barad, "human bodies, like all other bodies, are not entities with inherent boundaries and properties but phenomena that acquire specific boundaries and properties through the open-ended dynamics of intra-activity" (Barad 2007, 172). Barad's posthuman performativity extends Foucault and Butler's analysis on the materialization of bodies by attending to the apparatuses through which human and nonhuman bodies are differentially constituted. "In an agential realist account, performativity is understood not as iterative citationality (Butler) but as <i>iterative intra-activity</i>" (Barad 2007, 184, emphasis in original). Remember, drawing a boundary of intelligibility wherein certain properties are made determinate requires that part of the world, the part of which it is not, be rendered unintelligible and indeterminate. The intelligibility and determinacy of a body/story -- necessitates exclusions. Therefore, "agency is the space of possibilities opened up by the indeterminacies entailed in exclusions" (Barad 2007, 182).

    Murris and Bozalek (2019) continue:
    <br><br><span class="quote">
      As a researcher is one part of the world, hence a diffractive reading is unlike a literature review as the latter assumes that you are at a distance of the literature, having a bird's eye point of view - creating an overview by comparing, contrasting, juxtaposing or looking for similarities and themes. A diffractive reading, on the other hand, does not foreground any texts as foundational, but through reading texts through one another, comes to new insights. (1505-1506)
    </span>
  </p>

  <p>Though not foregrounding any one text, diffractive reading <i>is</i> "rigorously attentive to important details of specialized arguments within a given field without uncritically endorsing or uncondi­tionally prioritizing one (inter)disciplinary approach over another" (Barad 2007, 93). A diffractive methodology attends to the relational ontology of agential realism (Barad 2007, 389) rather than a flat ontology. Drawing from deep mapping literatures and practices, Springett (2015) offers the spatiotemporal descriptor of 'deep' rather than 'flat' to gesture towards the democratization of knowledge through enactments that retain an ethical and political bent by attending to social and ecological hierarchies; for her, deep mapping emerges as a performative practice for undoing or decolonizing the way people engage with place.  Ian Biggs describes deep mapping as an 'essaying' of place that is about "<i>interweaving</i> many disparate, tensioned strands of experience, genres of writing, knowledge positions and narrative perspectives so as to produce a richer, more resonant patterning of meaning while retaining the pleasures of discrete threads within the larger whole" (Biggs 2010, emphasis in original). Like a diffractive reading, such an interweaving remains cognizant of differences while feeling for resonances.  
  </p>
  <p>
    In negative-spaces/disorientation.html, I introduced deep mapping as eluding operationalization in its interpretive capaciousness (Roberts 2016; Modeen and Biggs 2020). This is not to say that theories and practices of deep mapping are never dissonant. Contrasting two publications on deep mapping, specifically Deep Maps and Spatial Narratives by Bodenhamer, Corrigan, and Harris (2015) and Deep Mapping by Roberts (2016), Modeen and Biggs (2020) mark the distinction between approaches which are "literalist and instrumentalist" such as the former publication, and those, like the later, which are "scholarly and creative" (Modeen and Biggs 2020, 52). The thing is that both publications cite many of the same ppl. more about how theyre interpreting. It comes as no surprise that the authors who wrote "A deep map is . . . an environment embedded with tools to bring data into an explicit and direct relationship with space and time" (Bodenhamer, Corrigan, and Harris 2015, x) went on to publish an edited volume concerned with articulating methods of making deep maps (Bodenhamer, Corrigan, and Harris 2021). As discussed in the preceding section, my thinking and practice are deeply diffracted through Roberts' work. However, as nuanced above, reading Barad <i>through</i> my understanding of deep mapping as influenced by Roberts has led to me think more carefully about boundaries and how they are drawn. [could put stakes here or anything argumentative that doesn't fit at end of prior section] 
  </p>

  <p>
    Given my hesitation to identify with either capacious approach to deep mapping laid out by Modeen and Biggs (2020), I wonder if my interest in posthuman embodiment and agential realism may be indicative of a third strand of deep mapping practice, one which remains scholarly and creative while not presupposing the existence of intelligible formations such as human, space, time, data, or the field prior to their encounter. That is, perhaps they take shape only in entanglement with the researcher… As hinted in  negative-spaces/disorientation.html I realize the city is not a site with fixed boundaries and determinate properties which preexist encounter and which I, as inhabitant-geographer-cartographer, may irresponsibly separate myself from in order to map from a distanced, exterior position. Rather, the city is performatively constituted as a physical-conceptual field whose emergent topology is iteratively drawn through everyday navigations and encounters. As such, the city of my inhabitation and I are entangled, figured and continuously reconfiguring in dynamic relation. What I meant by 'deep mapping eludes operationalization', and where I am resonant with Modeen and Biggs' (2020) scholarly and creative approach, is that practice of deep mapping cannot be reduced to a sequence of ordered steps. To do so would be to  foreclose the "poetics of paradox and ambiguity essential to open deep mapping" (Modeen and Biggs 2020, 53). If anything, contrasting views highlight how deep mapping cannot be captured by any single strategy, even as self-identified cognoscenti cl/aim to define one. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Post qualitative inquiry refuses the capture of method entirely; it "must be invented, created differently each time… The goal of post qualitative inquiry is not to systematically repeat a preexisting research reprocess to produce[sic] a recognizable result but to experiment and create something new and different that might <i>not</i> be recognizable in existing structures of intelligibility" (St. Pierre 2021a, 5-6, emphasis in original). It was through writing her dissertation that Elizabeth St. Pierre first encountered the incommensurabilities between humanist qualitative methodology and poststructural theories (St. Pierre 2018, 603). St. Pierre (2018) describes how normalized it was in graduate school to first pick a set of (qualitative) methods with which to gather data, then apply the theory one was reading to the data gathered. Upon reflection and the thinking immanent to writing, St. Pierre realized her methodological choice to conduct in-person interviews valorized a speaking subject, presence, and language in a manner antithetical to the theory she sought to apply. In short, St. Pierre discovered "conventional humanist qualitative methodological concepts like <i>interview</i>, the <i>field</i>, and <i>data</i>" (2018, 606, emphasis in original) to be unintelligible within her poststructural theoretical framework.

   <!-- <p>  
    At the time I was simultaneously practicing deep mapping as I walked and biked around Vancouver and preparing to lead a workshop on developing a walkability index with a geographic information system (GIS). 
     Much of my fieldwork has involved navigating Vancouver, my empirics emerging as inextricable layerings of sensorium, affect, and infrastructure. Alongside my thesis I have TAed a departmental cartography course as well as completed cartographic research assistance and freelance cartography. I also work in the university library Research Commons, teaching and consulting on geospatial matters as well as developing and facilitating workshops on mapping and geographic information systems (GIS). 
      <br><br>
        One of the workshops I led for the library was on building walkability indexes with GIS (“Network Analysis,” n.d.). GIS, or geographic information systems, are the computational programs, desktop applications, and infrastructural hardware that facilitate the distribution, visualization, and analysis of geospatial data. Geospatial data are data for which a locational property, such as coordinate or street address, is measured. Much like excel assists in performing mathematical calculations on numerical datasets or Nvivo helps highlight patterns across qualitative records, GIS assist in performing spatial analysis on georeferenced datasets. A walkability index is a quantitative assessment of the relative accessibility of amenities within a delineated area. The workshop assumed as its empirics geospatial datasets which render the city down from above as a collection of points, lines, and polygons. Indeed, it is possible to make the  entire index without any reference to on-the-ground, everyday navigations. Given geospatial data representing Vancouver's city blocks, population density, and amenities, GIS provides the tools to analyze proximity and connection, as well as visualize the result through a map.
        <br><br>
      Around the same time as I was preparing to present the walkability workshop, I began noticing these '15 minute City <span style="font-weight:500">Ready</span>' stickers popping up along the Vancouver Greenway, a stretch of the old Canadian Pacific railroad that's been transposed into a designated pedestrian and bike path. Conceptualized by city planner Carlos Moreno, the '15 minute city' is the idea “that cities should be designed or redesigned so that, within the distance of a 15-minute walk or bike ride, people should be able to live the essence of what constitutes the urban experience: to access work, housing, food, health, education, culture and leisure” (Moreno 2020). Over the course of the spring, more stickers appeared, pasted over DO NOT ENTER EXCEPT BICYCLES signs and those yellow/black striped hazard markers. At the same time that the stickers began proliferating east, west, and even across the bridge into downtown, they also began being scratched off. Reapplication, however, was swift. Then I sighted something different: at first one then two sites, scrawled in blue sharpie over '15 minute City <span style="font-weight:500">Ready</span>' was the declaration RESIST.
      <br><br>
        But resist what? Well it turns out the '15 minute City <span style="font-weight:500">Ready</span>' stickers are actually in protest of the ‘15 minute city’––the decal’s chain-link background representing enforced limited mobility. The location and surface of the stickers' placement is therefore significant. The signification of protest comes to matter through the stickers’ material-semiotic interference with infrastructural boundary demarcations. City signs become palimpsests––sites of super/im/position signaling contested urbanisms. This led me to think about how proximity and connection are measured, the city imagined, and urban space produced through both technoscientific and affective spatial practices. 
        Thinking these modes of inquiry through one another, I began to wonder how empirics are made legible as data by the apparatuses that produce them. And, how technoscientific and affective orientations to ‘what counts as data’ co-constitutive of an empirical account of the city. I carried these questions with me throughout the summer and, sitting on a log at Maple Wood Flats, I sketched out how a diffractive mapping would move forward such an exploration.

I also took many an after zoom-class walk here with an interlocutor who used to live nearby and whose home I would tune in from.

    I went down to spanish banks<br>
    at low tide and found the sand<br>
    exposed like infinite ribs.<br><br>
    I gathered myself beside<br>
    shallow ponds of ocean<br>
    and felt the throb of tanker<br>
    engines with my fingers.<br><br>
    A man gave me his fire and<br>
    a stranger, some wood.<br><br>
    I watched them consume<br>
    each other feeling warmed<br>
    by the kindness of people<br>
    I'd never know.<br><br>
