    <span style="font-weight:700">WAVES</span><br>
    Waves are all around in the form of water, sound vibrations, and electromagnetic radiation. The colors humans can see comprise only a small portion of electromagnetic radiation on the electromagnetic spectrum, which ranges from radio waves with the longest wavelength to gamma ray waves with the shortest wavelength. A microwave appliance heats your food in minutes or less by radiating microwaves––whose wavelength is 100,000 times shorter than a radio waves, yet still 20,000 times greater than visible-to-humans light––into the food, exciting its molecules whose vibration results in heat. The spectrum of visible-to-human light ranges from red, whose wavelength is the longest, to violet, whose wavelength is the shortest. Though bees cannot see red, they can see ultraviolet light (Shipman 2011) which is just beyond the violet perceptible to humans. Infrared radiation, whose wavelength is just longer than visible red, may be felt as heat. Infrared sensors are used for thermal imaging, night-vision apparatuses, and studying cloud structure among other things (National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Science Mission Directorate 2010a, 2010b). A portion of the sun's incoming solar radiation is reflected by the earth as infrared. Remote sensors on satellites collect data on reflected near-infrared waves which, as I once did in a college remote sensing course, can be processed into false-color imagery to assess vegetation cover and crop health (National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Science Mission Directorate 2010b). In highschool, I had a wonderful environmental science teacher who explained how scientists can tell whether a star is moving towards us or away from us by the color of light it appears to be emitting. Similar to the Doppler effect characteristic of siren wails, when a star is moving towards us/Earth/the instrument of investigation, the electromagnetic radiation it is emitting becomes "scrunched up" in front of it, decreasing the wavelengths so that the visible light being emitted appears blue to the human eye. This is known as blueshift. On the other hand, when a star is moving away from us/Earth/the instrument of investigation, the electromagnetic radiation behind it becomes more and more "stretched out" and so what visible light is being emitted appears red to the human eye. This is known as redshift. In biology the following year I learned that plant leaves look green because in the process of photosynthesis, where light, water, and carbon dioxide are transformed into sugar and oxygen within plant cells, the wavelengths of light responsible for the visible colors red and blue are absorbed whilst those of green and yellow-green are reflected. This is all to say waves are ambient, effecting what you can see, feel, and hear.

    When two or more waves occupy the same space in time they are said to be <span style="font-weight:500">superpositioned</span>. Superpositioned waves do not oppose one another but interfere, their displacements combining to produce a new wave. Constructive interference occurs when superpositioned waves are in phase with one another, meaning the crests and troughs of all waves align. Destructive interference occurs when superpositioned waves are out of phase, when crests from one wave align with troughs of another for example. The patterning of interference is called a <span style="font-weight:500">diffraction pattern</span>. Particles occupy distinct positions in time and space; two particles cannot be in the same place at once. Thus, particles cannot produce diffraction patterns. Only waves can produce diffraction patterns because only waves can be superpositioned.

      Sometime in early pandemic quarantine, I performed a diffraction experiment of my own in a pitch-black bathroom for my undergraduate physics course. The medium of inquiry was not water, however, but light. Using a laser pointer, I sent a beam of light through a piece of tinfoil with two razor-thin slits next to one another, both vertical and parallel to one another. On the wall beyond, a pattern of alternating bright and dark stripes appeared. I have recreated the set-up and detailed the experiment below.

        Passing through the tinfoil, the laster beam is bifurcated by the double slit and spreads out as it emanates from both openings. What is rendered visible on the wall beyond is a diffraction pattern marking the effects of the interference of these two waves of light. The bright stripes on the wall mark where constructive interference occurred, constituting a new wave whose heightened amplitudes effected a brighter light. The dark stripes mark the effect of destructive interference, where superpositioned waves were out of phase, effectively canceling each other out to produce no light at all. The observation of bright and dark stripes - kindly captured in my recreation by my partner - was worth the postage required to ship DIY kits across the country to quarantined undergraduate students because it illuminated light behaving as a wave. Light can also behave as a (subatomic) particle. A photon is a discreet physical quantity, or quantum, of the electromagnetic field; a photon is a quantum of light (Barad 2015, 395). While light may behave as both wave and particle, it cannot be apprehended as both at once. That is to say, wave and particle are entangled states. The first double-slit diffraction experiment was conducted by Thomas Young in 1801, and the investigative setup has since been employed to explore such quantum entanglements as the wave-particle duality of matter.

        With this page, I introduce diffraction as a way to figure what is rendered of an interference practice such as deep mapping. I offer my first iteration at a theory of deep mapping, and situate my subsequent and current theorization within the Baradian framework my thinking is iteratively diffracted through. Because I have limited space and time - constrained as I am by the length and requirements of this degree project - I restrain myself from giving as in-depth an account of what I've learned as I would like - focusing rather on providing clarity and context to my arguments.

    <span style="font-weight:700">DIFFRACTION</span><br>
    Deep mapping disorients representationalist dualisms by assuming the field of encounter as interlocutor. In both deep mapping (practice) and making space for deep mapping (rendering), I aim to produce ‘situated knowledges’ wherein the object of knowledge is engaged as actor and agent (Haraway 1988, 592). Yet objects, much like places as we will see, are not preexisting entities but “boundary projects” whose “boundaries are drawn by mapping practices” (Haraway 1988, 595). Recall the cartography assignment introduced in <a href="./disorientation.html">disorientation.html</a>. Not only did tracing a map stand <i>in place</i> of spatial practice, the traced map stood in place of the map making practices which constituted it. The course assignment recommended a source statement of “Google Maps”, effectively erasing the illustration software with which the map was created, the computers on which the software ran, the internet connection and browsers which rendered Google Maps visible to screenshot, the lab instructions, my own directives and acquired technical expertise as course TA… in short, the entire apparatus of the map’s production. Thus, the assignment irresponsibly reproduced a “gaze from nowhere” (Haraway 1988, 581) whereby the producers of geographic knowledge (in this case, the mappers) remained unimplicated in, and therefore unaccountable to, the boundary drawing practices entailed in rendering an object of knowledge (in this case, a place).  
    <br><br>
    In a shift away from geometric optics' visual metaphors that privilege a “fixed position”, Haraway (1991, 70) suggests diffraction. She writes, “diffraction is a mapping of interference, not of replica­tion, reflection, or reproduction. A diffraction pattern does not map where differences appear, but rather maps where the <i>effects</i> of difference appear” (Haraway 1991, 70, emphasis in original). Encountering the effects of interference actually led to my first iteration at a theory of deep mapping. The following is from January 2022, my first winter in Vancouver.

      Some grey day I walked the stretch of shoreline that wraps around the University of British Columbia. With the Salish Sea on one side and a forest of evergreens and sword ferns to the other, campus is geographically and administratively separated from the City of Vancouver. It also occupies the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam) people. A five minute walk from the Geography Department takes me to a zig-zag staircase at the bottom of which awaits a place where clothing is optional. My shoes and socks are the first to come off. The sand is cold and firm, yet porous. It holds the impression of my soles and reshapes in my hands. I contain it for a moment, appreciating its texture, then let it go. 
      <br><br>
      Sunshine was a precious thing my first winter in Vancouver when it rained for four months straight. The cloud cover was so dense that a dimple of white was the only indication our star remained. Monochrome days used to really kill my vibe. There is a dullness to a landscape lit ambiently, a non-differentiation that makes it difficult to articulate thoughts. That day I paused at ocean’s edge where barnacles encrust the rocks and molluscs cling together in crunchy bundles. In and out rolled the waves, and I breathed with them. On each exhale I noticed how foam gathered around the rocks at my feet, forming bubbles on whose surface spun psychedelic spirals.

      <br>
      This happens due to thin film interference, where light waves reflecting off the surface of a bubble overlap with waves which have been transmitted through the film, reflected back, and refracted at the surface at the angle of incidence. When refracted waves are shifted so as to be in-synch with those reflected, they interfere constructively to make visible an abundance of colors. Deep mapping is constructive interference with the superficial reflection that is place rendered (down from above) by flat maps. It's a multidimensional praxis of inhabitation. Mapping deeply requires entering the landscape––putting one’s self into the field––and emerging to render a cartography beyond the monochrome.

    <br>
  <p>While walking False Creek that winter, I shared this idea with an interlocutor who recommended I read the above Haraway (1991) on diffraction. The limitation of geometric optics and its attendant reflections is further elaborated by Karen Barad (2003; 2007) (whom I encountered via serendipitous google search after reading Haraway), who explains how diffraction can only be understood using physical optics. Importantly, whereas geometric optics relies on classical (Newtownian) physics, physical optics are explained using quantum physics. Unlike classical physics, quantum physics allows for superpositions, for entangled states. <span style="color: #a88acf; ">[I have whole bit on reflexivity critiques I could put here but will take time to develop so bracketing for now]</span> What is needed to produce 'situated knowledges' (Haraway 1988) (of the place one inhabits) is not reflexivity on the part of the researcher, or an merely an  approach which counters the hegemonic one, but an account of <i>how</i> differences come to matter as the effect of boundary making practices.  
    </p>

    <p>
     In <i>Meeting the Universe Halfway: Quantum Physics and the Entanglement of Matter and Meaning</i> (2007), Barad attends to this by "building diffractive apparatuses to study the entangled effects differences make" (73). After reading Haraway on diffraction, I was googling for more from the humanities and social sciences on the matter when I came upon Barad's opus. <i>Meeting the Universe Halfway</i> gave me a language to think about what it meant to theorize and practice everyday urban geography from within and as part of a city. I am thus beholden to this account my theory and praxis are so diffracted through. 
      </p>
      
      <p>Barad (2007) conducts a close reading of Niels Bohr's philosophy-physics to illuminate Bohr's complementarity relation as explanation for quantum entanglements, particularly the wave-particle duality of matter. Position and momentum, properties of particles and waves respectively, are indeterminate prior to their measurement. It is not that they are uncertain––that they exist but remain unknown due to the act of measurement effecting the recoded value, as Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle would have it––but that they do not exist to be known before the act of measurement. Barad underlines this as a shift from epistemic (uncertainty as a matter of knowing) to ontic (indeterminacy as a matter of being) (Barad 2007, 118 and 127). Reading the writing of Niels Bohr and Michel Foucault through one another, Barad defines apparatuses as ongoing and open-ended material-discursive boundary making practices which resolve the indeterminacy of a property by performing an "agential cut" whereby the "agencies of observation" and "object of observation" are differentially articulated. "Agencies of observation" and "object of observation" are provisional configurations––entangled states which "intra-actively" mark (mutually constitute) one another within and as part of phenomena. Within the double-slit diffraction experiment recreated above, myself, equipped with practical knowledge of the experimental setup and interpretation, the dark room and smooth walls, as well as the laser, camera and person taking photograph, tinfoil, Exacto knife, and binder clamps are marked as "agencies of observation" by the boundary making practice, or apparatus, through which the diffraction pattern is produced as an "object of observation". This distinction also presumes definite boundaries to all these agencies, eliding the apparatuses responsible for <i>their</i> mattering. If memory serves, in my undergraduate double-slit diffraction experiment the assignment was to calculate the wavelength of the laser beam's light using the distance between the two slits, the distance between the tinfoil and the middle bright stripe on the wall, and the distances between the bright stripes, also known as fringes. A ruler and calculator, then, were additional agencies of observation within the wave phenomenon where the diffraction pattern was the object of observation.
    </p>

    <p> Barad formulates an understanding of diffraction through the steady conceptual of <span style="font-weight:450">diff</span>erential int<span style="font-weight:450">ra-action</span>. Their use of the term 'intra-action' is of specific consequence: 
      <br><br>
        <!--intra action quote-->
        <span class="quote">
          The notion of <i>intra-action</i> (in contrast to the usual 'interaction,' which presumes the prior existence of independent entities or relata) represents a profound conceptual shift. It is through specific agential intra-actions that the boundaries and properties of the components of phenomenon become determinate and that particular concepts (that is, particular material articulations of the world) become meaningful. Intra-actions include the larger material arrangement (i.e., set of material practices) that effects an agential cut between 'subject' and 'object' (in contrast to the more familiar Cartesian cut which takes its distinction for granted). That is, the agential cut enacts a resolution within the phenomenon of the inherent ontological (and semantic) indeterminacy. (Barad 2007, 139, emphasis in original)

      </p>

        <p>
          But how are we to understand measurements? According to Barad's agential realism, "measured properties refer to phenomena…" (Barad 2007, 197, emphasis in original). Wave and particle are therefore phenomena within which momentum and position are made differentially determinate through apparatuses that constitute the mutually exclusive conditions for either property to become intelligible. Objectivity, Barad avers, is not gained from a distanced, exterior positioning. Rather, objectivity is about "<i>agential separability</i>––the condition of exteriority-within-phenomena. Separability is not inherent or absolute, but intra-actively enacted relative to a specific phenomenon" (Barad 2007, 339, emphasis in original). An objective account is one that recognizes the boundary making practice by which the object of observation as differentiated from agencies of observation is part of the phenomenon within which the measured property becomes intelligible. To measure the wavelength of light requires agential separability within the wave phenomenon. In a footnote Barad offers perhaps a more straightforward iteration of their argument: 
          <br>
          <span class="quote">
            measured values can be unambiguously and contingently attributed to the corresponding property of "objects-in-the-phenomenon" (not to some presumably independent object). This is possible in part because we are in essence matching the separability implicit in classical concepts between "subject" and "object" to the agential separability between "object-in-the-phenomenon" and "instrument-in-the-phenomenon" (see Barad 1996). The contingent part of this relation must be attended to (i.e., it must be acknowledged that the objective referent is ultimately the phenomenon), or objectivity will be unachievable." (2007, 465). 
          </span>
          <br>
          An objective account is one that recognizes the boundary making practice by which the object of observation as differentiated from agencies of observation is part of the phenomenon within which the measured property becomes intelligible. A map is only objective given a source statement that accounts for the apparatuses of its production. In the assignment I taught, the Cartesian cut which makes distinction for granted was at play as mappers were assumed subjects and a place, the object. The effects of their tracing Google Maps, their map of downtown, was a representation which -- conveyed it. The representation - trace - stood in place. it was place. representationalist logic etc. downtown, google maps, mappers - all presumed independent objects and subjects and instruments.  the source was what was traced as in another cartesian map, not the practices which assumed that representation and then distinction at end. What would a baradian objective source statement be/ how might a Baradian objective source statement read? Alternative to cartesian mapping? counter mapping practices etc. I argue that an embodied approach isn't automatically  more objective, as will see in next section….

  <p>
    Barad employs what they describe as a diffractive methodology to "think[] insights from different disciplines (and interdisciplinary approaches) through one another" (2007, 93). A diffractive methodology differs from a diffractive apparatus, for, as articulated above, apparatuses are boundary making practices not experimental setups, methods, tactics, or otherwise agencies of observation. Indeed, apparatuses are the very practices responsible for making determinate, within a given phenomenon, what is marked as an agency of observation and what is the object of observation. Diffraction phenomena are at times object of investigation, at other times, apparatus of investigation, though never both at once (Barad 2007, 73). I understand engaging a diffractive methodology to be the negotiation of this entanglement––an exploration through the iterative interplay of generating interferences and studying diffraction patterns to understand how differences come to matter. 
    </p>

    <p>Diffractive reading is about reading <i>through</i> rather than against: interference rather than opposition, diffraction rather than reflection. "Diffractive readings bring inventive provocations" says Barad in an interview (Barad quoted in van der Tuin and Dolphijn 2012). Drawing from Barad (2007, 2010, 2014, 2015, 2017) and Haraway (1992, 1997, 2000), Murris and Bozalek (2019) develop propositions for guiding diffractive reading of texts. What I find most admirable is that they do so by putting Barad's diffractive methodology into practice. Their article marks the effects of their diffractive reading of 1. propositions generated from another exercise in diffractive reading, and 2. their article itself. Thus, in the process of formation, their article serves as a diffractive apparatus while what's rendered through publication is a diffraction pattern marking the effects of their interference practice. They write: <br><br>
    <span class="quote">
      The challenge in adopting diffraction as a methodology is not to <i>theorise</i> the diffraction pattern (a logic of representation), but to put it into <i>practice</i>, thereby disrupting the theory/practice binary. The idea is to read theory <i>with</i> practice diffractively guided by, for example, key questions that move the experiment forward. (Murris and Bozalek 2019, 1505, emphasis in original)
    </span>
    <br>
    This is what I have attempted to do in my master's research-creation by theorizing deep mapping through practice and enacting my theory as praxis in ongoing iteration. I also put the theory I read into practice in order to learn it, thinking it through my practice and theory of deep mapping so far to glean new insights. Encountering Haraway (1992/1) an then Barad (2003, 2007, 2012, 2015) a few months after encountering the bubble caused my theory to change from constructive interference, where superpositioned waves must be in-synch, to simply interference. Beyond considering what it might mean to think with place and feel the city, questions emerging from my praxis are posed at the end of this page and taken up in the next. Murris and Bozalek (2019) continue:
    <br><br><span class="quote">
      As a researcher is one part of the world, hence a diffractive reading is unlike a literature review as the latter assumes that you are at a distance of the literature, having a bird's eye point of view - creating an overview by comparing, contrasting, juxtaposing or looking for similarities and themes. A diffractive reading, on the other hand, does not foreground any texts as foundational, but through reading texts through one another, comes to new insights. (1505-1506)
    </span>
  </p>

  <p>Though not foregrounding any texts, diffractive reading <i>is</i> "rigorously attentive to important details of specialized arguments within a given field without uncritically endorsing or uncondi­tionally prioritizing one (inter)disciplinary approach over another" (Barad 2007, 93). A diffractive methodology attends to the relational ontology of agential realism (Barad 2007, 389) rather than a flat ontology. Drawing from deep mapping literatures and practices, Springett (2015) offers the spatiotemporal descriptor of 'deep' rather than 'flat' to gesture towards the democratization of knowledge through enactments that retain an ethical and political bent by attending to social and ecological hierarchies; for her, deep mapping emerges as a performative practice for undoing or decolonizing the way people engage with place. Ian Biggs' describes deep mapping as an 'essaying' of place that is about "<i>interweaving</i> many disparate, tensioned strands of experience, genres of writing, knowledge positions and narrative perspectives so as to produce a richer, more resonant patterning of meaning while retaining the pleasures of discrete threads within the larger whole" (Biggs 2010, emphasis in original). Like a diffractive reading, such an interweaving remains cognizant of differences while feeling for resonances. 
  </p>
  <p>
    In negative-spaces/disorientation.html, I introduced deep mapping as eluding operationalization in its interpretive capaciousness (Roberts 2016; Modeen and Biggs 2020). This is not to say that theories and practices of deep mapping are never dissonant. Contrasting two publications on deep mapping, Bodenhamer, Corrigan, and Harris (2015) and Roberts (2016), Modeen and Biggs (2020)  mark the distinction between approaches which are "literalist and instrumentalist" such as the former publication, and those, like the later, which are "scholarly and creative" (Modeen and Biggs 2020, 52). It comes as no surprise that the authors who wrote "A deep map is . . . an environment embedded with tools to bring data into an explicit and direct relationship with space and time" (Bodenhamer, Corrigan, and Harris 2015, x) went on to publish an edited volume concerned with articulating methods of making deep maps (Bodenhamer, Corrigan, and Harris 2021). Les Roberts, the editor of the <i>Humanities</i> special issue cited, has since written further on deep mapping and spatial bricolage, editing another <i>Humanities</i> special issue (Roberts 2018a) and publishing a book elaborating his interpretation of spatial anthropology (Roberts 2018). As discussed in the preceding section, my thinking and practice are deeply diffracted through Roberts' work. However, as nuanced above, reading Barad through my understanding of deep mapping as influenced by Roberts has led to me think more carefully about boundaries and how they are drawn. Given my hesitation to identify with either capacious approach to deep mapping laid out by Modeen and Biggs (2020), I wonder if my interest in posthuman embodiment and agential realism may be indicative of a third strand of deep mapping practice, one which remains scholarly and creative while not presupposing the existence of intelligible formations such as human, space, time, data, or the field. What I meant by 'deep mapping eludes operationalization', and where I am resonant with Modeen and Biggs' (2020) scholarly and creative approach, is that practice of deep mapping cannot be reduced to a sequence of ordered steps. To do so would be to  foreclose the "poetics of paradox and ambiguity essential to open deep mapping" (Modeen and Biggs 2020, 53). If anything, contrasting views highlight how deep mapping cannot be captured by any single method, even as self-identified cognoscenti cl/aim to define one. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Post qualitative inquiry refuses the capture of method entirely; it "must be invented, created differently each time… The goal of post qualitative inquiry is not to systematically repeat a preexisting research reprocess to produce[sic] a recognizable result but to experiment and create something new and different that might <i>not</i> be recognizable in existing structures of intelligibility" (St. Pierre 2021a, 5-6, emphasis in original). It was through writing her dissertation that Elizabeth St. Pierre first encountered the incommensurabilities between humanist qualitative methodology and poststructural theories (St. Pierre 2018, 603). St. Pierre (2018) describes how normalized it was in graduate school to first pick out a set of qualitative methods with which to gather data, then applying the theory one was reading to the data gathered. Upon reflection and the thinking immanent to writing, St. Pierre realized her methodological choice to conduct in-person interviews valorized a speaking subject, presence, and language in ways directly contested by the theory she sought to apply. St. Pierre discovered "conventional humanist qualitative methodological concepts like <i>interview</i>, the <i>field</i>, and <i>data</i>" (2018, 606, emphasis in original) were unintelligible within her poststructural theoretical framework. Last spring (2023) I came to a similar conundrum.
     <!-- At the time I was simultaneously practicing deep mapping as I walked and biked around Vancouver and preparing to lead a workshop on developing a walkability index with a geographic information system (GIS).  -->
     Much of my fieldwork has involved navigating Vancouver, my empirics emerging as inextricable layerings of sensorium, affect, and infrastructure. Alongside my thesis I have TAed a departmental cartography course as well as completed cartographic research assistance and freelance cartography. I also work in the university library Research Commons, teaching and consulting on geospatial matters as well as developing and facilitating workshops on mapping and geographic information systems (GIS). 
      <br><br>
        One of the workshops I led for the library was on building walkability indexes with GIS (“Network Analysis,” n.d.). GIS, or geographic information systems, are the computational programs, desktop applications, and infrastructural hardware that facilitate the distribution, visualization, and analysis of geospatial data. Geospatial data are data for which a locational property, such as coordinate or street address, is measured. Much like excel assists in performing mathematical calculations on numerical datasets or Nvivo helps highlight patterns across qualitative records, GIS assist in performing spatial analysis on georeferenced datasets. A walkability index is a quantitative assessment of the relative accessibility of amenities within a delineated area. The workshop assumed as its empirics geospatial datasets which render the city down from above as a collection of points, lines, and polygons. Indeed, it is possible to make the  entire index without any reference to on-the-ground, everyday navigations. Given geospatial data representing Vancouver's city blocks, population density, and amenities, GIS provides the tools to analyze proximity and connection, as well as visualize the result through a map.
        <br><br>
      Around the same time as I was preparing to present the walkability workshop, I began noticing these '15 minute City <span style="font-weight:500">Ready</span>' stickers popping up along the Vancouver Greenway, a stretch of the old Canadian Pacific railroad that's been transposed into a designated pedestrian and bike path. Conceptualized by city planner Carlos Moreno, the '15 minute city' is the idea “that cities should be designed or redesigned so that, within the distance of a 15-minute walk or bike ride, people should be able to live the essence of what constitutes the urban experience: to access work, housing, food, health, education, culture and leisure” (Moreno 2020). Over the course of the spring, more stickers appeared, pasted over DO NOT ENTER EXCEPT BICYCLES signs and those yellow/black striped hazard markers. At the same time that the stickers began proliferating east, west, and even across the bridge into downtown, they also began being scratched off. Reapplication, however, was swift. Then I sighted something different: at first one then two sites, scrawled in blue sharpie over '15 minute City <span style="font-weight:500">Ready</span>' was the declaration RESIST.
      <br><br>
        But resist what? Well it turns out the '15 minute City <span style="font-weight:500">Ready</span>' stickers are actually in protest of the ‘15 minute city’––the decal’s chain-link background representing enforced limited mobility. The location and surface of the stickers' placement is therefore significant. The signification of protest comes to matter through the stickers’ material-semiotic interference with infrastructural boundary demarcations. City signs become palimpsests––sites of super/im/position signaling contested urbanisms. This led me to think about how proximity and connection are measured, the city imagined, and urban space produced through both technoscientific and affective spatial practices. 
        Thinking these modes of inquiry through one another, I began to wonder how empirics are made legible as data by the apparatuses that produce them. And, how technoscientific and affective orientations to ‘what counts as data’ co-constitutive of an empirical account of the city. I carried these questions with me throughout the summer and, sitting on a log at Maple Wood Flats, I sketched out how a diffractive mapping would move forward such an exploration.

    It is with postqualitative research in mind that Murris and Bozalek (2019) reference methodology skeptically, preferring to describe their invitations for practicing diffractive reading as 'propositions.' Propositions gleaned through their prior diffractive reading are marked by indentation and an alternate font,  each one an invitation to "to live without bodily boundaries by:...". Propositions marking the diffractive reading of the article at hand are differentiated by numbers, though no hierarchy is intended.  I read these propositions through my own work, interweaving them as relevant further on.

    <span style="font-weight:700">TRACE AND PRACTICE </span><br>
    We live in a moment where locative technology is ubiquitous. Becoming lost no longer requires going out of one's way. Instead, "disoriented discovery" (Kurgan 2013) begins with a choice to not reference Google Maps, to turn location off and allow position to remain indeterminate. Reading Barad (2007) and de Certeau (1984) through one another, I believe place and space to be phenomenal expressions of the world differentially articulated through trace and practice. I am particularly interested in how pedestrian tracings of Google Maps––a locative technology which renders the city down from above as a place––inform everyday navigations and thus the production of (urban) space. How does Google Maps define intra-actions between humans and urban infrastructure, becoming part of dialogue with the urban surround it both enables and constrains? How are categories like human|nonhuman or field|researcher performatively constituted through embodied methodologies and sensory, more-than-human, and imaginative (Elliott and Culhane 2017) ethnographies? I wonder how posthuman embodiment might inform mapping practices in ways that reconfigure delimitations presumed by Google Maps. While I leave more thorough investigation to my PhD, I want to sketch out some Ideas as they are inspired by this project and supported by my theoretical and practical investigations so far.

    In <i>The Practice of Everyday Life</i> (1984), Michel de Certeau relationally articulates space and place with the following: "<i>space is a practiced place</i>” (117, emphasis in original). He writes,

    Google’s map of Vancouver abides by the law of the “proper”. It produces the city as a place wherein each element has a distinct location. Position is made determinate by a spatial configuration which “excludes the possibility of two things being in the same location (<i>place</i>)” (de Certeau 1984, 117, emphasis in original). Such a static coordination allows for navigation to be routed (by Google) from one element to another. The navigational possibilities, however, remain determined (and constrained) by the law whose logic governs the map: follow streets, not alleys; walk on sidewalks; don’t jay-walk; turn right here, not at the next block. Disorientation is a destination not found by Google Maps, which asks in response, "Should this place be on Google Maps?"  (“Google Maps” n.d.).

  <p>Yet de Certeau contends it is pedestrian movements that spatialize the city, writing, “space is composed of intersections of mobile elements…space occurs as the effect produced by the operations that orient it, situate it, temporalize it…” (1984, 117). While urban geographers and planners may theorize and design the city, urban space is produced through everyday navigations and encounters. If the apprehension of place renders position determinate, the motion that spatializes renders position indeterminate: “to walk is to lack a place” (de Certeau 1984, 103). Google Maps imposes the law of the “proper” upon navigation by substituting “a mark in place of acts, a relic in place of performances: it is only their remainder, the sign of their erasure” (de Certeau 1984, 35, emphasis in original).

    <br>
    Deep mapping does not render down to a map in the sense of a Cartesian cartography, where action is made legible by the substitution of trace for practice (de Certeau 1984, 97). Yet neither does it ‘counter cartography’ (c.f. Mason-Deese 2020). Remember that in my theorization, articulated through practice, deep mapping is not defined by opposition so much as marked through iterative acts of interference with hegemonic forms of representing place, producing geographic knowledge, and rendering spatial research. Understood thus, deep mapping is not a methodology but a open-ended and ongoing boundary making practice––a Baradian diffractive apparatus for generating interferences and studying how the effects of difference, marked by diffraction patterns, come to matter (Barad 2007). Deep mapping is an approach to representing place, producing geographic knowledge, and rendering spatial research which recognizes, as Barad does, that “knowing, thinking, measuring, theorizing, and observing are material practices of intra-acting within and as part of the world” (2007, 90).  It is through the effects of practicing deep mapping that deep mapping becomes articulated as an apparatus of investigation. At times a site of interference, at times a tactic, deep mapping has proved for me a means to study the entangled states of limit and transgression.

    Defining thesis, Rendering theory = marking the effects of a practice → Rendering is a boundary making practice →  Negative-spaces is a diffraction pattern marking the effects of an interference practice, itself a diffractive apparatus.  It is through the effects of practicing deep mapping that deep mapping becomes articulated as an apparatus of investigation. How, then, might the effect of interferences be marked while accounting for the apparatus of their production? My thesis is an attempt to account for the practice of deep mapping through which my theorization is articulated, as well as the mapping practices entailed in rendering negative-spaces as an object of knowledge.
