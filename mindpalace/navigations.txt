NAVIGATIONS 
    navigations within a field articulate a framework, a mental map. 
    there are multiple ways to connect concepts, multiple pathways to understanding, multiple routes to a destination.
    process oriented recognizes the navigation as a site of learning. 

        "...navigation entails the production of a performative cartgraphy of a terrain, field, or domain that is constituted in the very act of its exploration...

        ...navigation itself produces knowledge that feeds into its course and experience itself.

        ...iterative loops between action, experience, and knowledge" 

            cites Paul Dourish 2001, 206:
            "Embodied Interaction is about the relationship between action and meaning, and the concept of practice that unites the two. Action and meaning are not opposites. From the perspective of embodiment, they form a duality. Action both produces and draws upon meaning; meaning both gives rise to and arises from action."
            
    Walking as a practice of thinking. Walking the Bridge. Vertical distance --> perspective/contexe, theorizing made more possible.  

    process oriented recognizes the navigation as a site of learning.

Detour 
        From my field notes, and written into the white space of A brief history of my body, by Billy-Ray Belcourt:
        
        I take the 33 bus to campus as a treat - something different, outside routine. It takes me through places I've
        been before but have yet to connect via this navigation. The city is daily reinvented in my imagination. It emerges for me, not through place making alone but through connections drawn by my movement between areas of familiarity. Lines between points expand out into planes of contingent perception which layer and stretch to pinch and intersect with one another. 

        ... 

        Later in the day I'm sitting outside with the same book, writing these musings from the _margins_ to html. A stranger approaches me and asks me, says I'm the only person he's seen today using a physical book. We get to talking. He's in his
        eighties, never travelled, says he talks instead to all sorts of people to build an understanding of the wider
        world. He offers me advice: something about detours being an important part of the journey. Be open. 
        
        Taking the 33 instead of the 99 B-Line to campus was a detour from my habitual route. I'd never taken the 33 before but it goes to show sponteneity (in my practical experience) is often met with serendipitous convergences. 
    
    Detour Maps
         Construction at the intersection disorient familiar navigations. Re-orientation can only be established from looking around; from the city's map -- only further disorientation. 
   
Lost (v.) Losing
    I lost my initial project outline when my computer broke unexpectedly. For two months (October - November) I worked analogue and between a friend's computer and the public library. Finally buying a new device I learned I'd have to wait till January to recover srivener files backed up (once, on a whim, call that spontaneous serendipity) to the cloud. 

    Losing my outline and writings from the fall was disorienting. However, it allowed for the re-formation of my thoughts and the push to figure out a different way to organize my writing. Without this detour I wouldn't have thought to use a code editor to write, git to save and track changes, and GitHub to organize my text in process. 


    Deep mapping is an exercise in slow scholarship: it takes time to know a place, to follow curiosity, to become lost. 


Orientation/Disorientation
    Like many colleagues, beginning a graduate program meant moving to a new city, biome, country. I arrived in Vancouver on the unceded lands of Coast Salish First Nations, disoriented.  I graded sixty maps of downtown before I finally ventured there. [insert paragraph from lecture I gave but the contents of which I lost to the cloud pending account recovery on january 9th.]
    While Google Maps helped me get from A to B, the drive to locate and coordinate precludes disoriented discovery.     

        "It seems as though in the end, maps —the successful ones, the ones that show us where we are and get us from here to there —risk offering only two alternatives. They let us see too much, and hence blind us to what we cannot see, imposing a quiet tyranny of orientation that erases the possibility of disoriented discovery, or they lose sight of all the other things that we ought to see. They omit, according to their conventions, those invisible lines of people, places, and networks that create the most common spaces we live in today." (Laura Kurgan, 16-17 from Close up and at a distance)

    For me, orientation evolved not through memorizing a map but by developing spatial awareness through everyday practices of engaging with the city.
