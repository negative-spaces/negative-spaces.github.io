            <p> My first view of Vancouver. The morning after I arrived, August 7th, I walked from 30th all the way down to the shore. I knew nothing of this place before coming here. I'd googled pictures of the city once back when I was deciding which offer to accept. <!--I could do a computational focused MSc. in San Diego, an professional program for cartography in the Twin Cities, a Geographic Information Science PhD in Texas, and a master's of applied geography in New Mexico.--> Each path led, in my mind, to a divergent trajectory. Who was I going to become? The pandemic began during the spring of my sophomore year of undergrad. Within 2 weeks my life radically altered and I decided to graduate the next year and go somewhere new. I spent a year isolated in rural Maine. It was there that I began walking in the woods, practicing something I called <a href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/4ab243f6d7b3490bbfa884d18a788236">isolation psychogeography.</a>  Under the mentorship of my Intro to GIS teacher, the best teacher I've ever known, I explored critical and creative cartographies for my honors thesis. My undergraduate studies were in physical geography and geographic information science. I chose geography because, as seems to be common among geography undergrads in the states, I had an exceptional AP Human Geography teacher in  UBC was the only MA program I applied to and though my final decision was on impulse, I think I felt the lure of openness to define my own project according to a mix of interests. And mentorship by someone who's skills and knowledge spanned a breadth of fields. Looking back on my research statement submitted this time two years ago (January 2021), my general aim remains the same: 
            <br><br>
                <span class="quote">I am a renaissance student whose skills in the arts and sciences unite in Geographic Information Science. My research interests lie in GeoVisualization, Critical Cartography, and the Geohumanities. I value both qualitative and quantitative methodologies, and am especially drawn to the ways both practices supplement each other. The research streams Digital Geographies, Geospatial Analysis, GIS and Knowledge, Ideas, Practices are both of interest to me for I seek the technical skills to map transdisciplinary patterns, not just conceptualize them. While my undergraduate background is in the physical sciences, I am fundamentally a creative whose passion lies with critical examinations of people, their interaction with each other, and response to the natural and built environment.</span><br>

            i've inhabited this place for a year and a half now. i drove to vancouver from the other side of the continent via somewhere in the middle of the united states. for the first time in my life i left a familiar place without a plan. i had no map save a Rand McNally Atlas of U.S. Road Atlas which i am embarrassed to say i forsook in favor of googles maps. even then, however, my journey unfolded in ways i never could have imagined and so slowly, i became comfortable with being uncomfortable. with not knowing what lies ahead. so much can happen between departure and destination. yet when the goal of a journey is the destination alone, getting lost is experienced as an inconvenience. therefore, maps are used to plot a path from A to B, departure to destination. with digital maps such as google maps, GPS will geolocate you in cartesian space so long as you remain in range of satellite reception. follow the directions spoken in synthesized sentences and you won't ever have to feel disoriented. you can't get lost. [recalculating...] you can't get lost<br>
            <br>
            <span style="margin-left: 5%;">unless you exit the navigation,</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            <span style="margin-left: 10%;">discard the map,</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            <span style="margin-left: 20%;">and reorient your attention to the space between departure and destination.</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            my journey to vancouver, into graduate school, and through this project until now has been a process of disoriented discovery. everything between departure and destination shapes where you end up. because deep mapping is process oriented research, so much of what went into articulating the negative spaces assembled above risks being relegated itself to negative space.to intentionally disorient oneself, to get lost as method, to slow down, to be guided by serendipity, to follow non-linear trajectories, to start something and start over. and over. and over and then claim that all this not only informs that which has coalesced as creative output but actually constitutes the research product is my commitment.
