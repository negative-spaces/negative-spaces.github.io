<!--Mapping Interference -->
<div>
  <p>
    Deep mapping disorients representationalist dualisms by assuming the field of encounter as interlocutor. In both deep mapping and making space for deep mapping, I aim to produce ‘situated knowledges’ wherein the object of knowledge is rendered as actor and agent (Haraway 1988, 592). Yet, much like place, “objects” are not preexisting entities but “boundary projects” whose “boundaries are drawn by mapping practices” (Haraway 1988, 595). Recall the cartography assignment from <a href="./disorientation.html">negative-spaces/disorientation.html</a>. Not only did tracing a map stand <i>in place</i> of spatial practice, the traced map stood in place of the mapping practices which constituted it. The assignment recommended a source statement of “Google Maps,” effectively erasing the illustration software with which the map was created, the computers on which the software ran, the internet connection and browsers which rendered Google Maps visible to screenshot, in short, the entire apparatus of the map’s production. Thus, the assignment uncritically reproduced a “gaze from nowhere” (Haraway 1988, 581) whereby the producers of geographic knowledge (in this case, the mappers) remained unimplicated in, and therefore unaccountable to, the boundary drawing practices entailed in rendering an object of knowledge (in this case, a place). <i>How might the effect of interferences be marked while accounting for the apparatus of their production? -> some segway</i>
    <br><br>
    Encountering the effects of interference actually led to my first iteration at a theory of deep mapping. The following is from January 2022, my first winter in Vancouver.

      Some grey day I walked the stretch of shoreline that wraps around the University of British Columbia. With the Salish Sea on one side and a forest of evergreens and sword ferns to the other, campus is geographically and administratively separated from the City of Vancouver. It also occupies the traditional, ancestral, unceded territory of the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam) people. A five minute walk from the Geography Department takes me to a zig-zag staircase at the bottom of which awaits a place where clothing is optional. My shoes and socks are the first to come off. The sand is cold and firm, yet porous. It holds the impression of my soles and reshapes in my hands. I contain it for a moment, appreciating its texture, then let it go. 
        <br><br>
        Sunshine was a precious thing my first winter in Vancouver when it rained for four months straight. The cloud cover was so dense that a dimple of white was the only indication our star remained. Monochrome days used to really kill my vibe. There is a dullness to a landscape lit ambiently, a non-differentiation that makes it difficult to articulate thoughts. That day I paused at ocean’s edge where barnacles encrust the rocks and molluscs cling together in crunchy bundles. In and out rolled the waves, and I breathed with them. On each exhale I noticed how foam gathered around the rocks at my feet, forming bubbles on whose surface spun psychedelic spirals.
      <br><br>

      </div>
<br>
  This happens due to thin film interference, where light waves reflecting off the surface of a bubble are interfered with by waves which have been transmitted through the film, reflected back, and refracted at the surface at the angle of incidence.      [interference pattern - destructive and constructive -- superposition] 
    <br>
    [sketch reference diagram]
    <br>
    When refracted waves are shifted so as to be in-synch with those reflected, they interfere constructively to make visible an abundance of colors. Deep mapping is constructive interference with the superficial reflection that is place rendered (down from above) by flat maps. It's a multidimensional praxis of inhabiting, with all the sensorium, the city where I am. Geography on the ground. Mapping deeply requires entering the landscape––putting one’s self into the field––and emerging to render a cartography beyond the monochrome. 
</div>
<br><br><br>

  <p>While walking False Creek, I shared this idea with an interlocutor who recommended I read the above Haraway (1991) on diffraction. In a shift away from visual metaphors that privilege a “fixed position,” Haraway (1991, 70) suggests diffraction. She writes, “diffraction is a mapping of interference, not of replica­tion, reflection, or reproduction. A diffraction pattern does not map where differences appear, but rather maps where the effects of difference appear” (Haraway 1991, 70).</p>

  <p>DIFFRACTION<br>
        Interference pattern --> diffraction
        January 2022; First conception/theorization of deep mapping as (constructive) interference - stepping "into" the field as it were, diffracting, and interfering with superficial reflections (basemap) to produce a cartography beyond the monochrome. Diffraction is when a wave meets obstacle or opening --> passes through --> bends --> waves interfere --> diffraction pattern aka interference pattern.<br><br>
