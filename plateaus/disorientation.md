# disorientation
I have come to understand being a geographer as less of an ability to know where you are in space at all times and more of a capacity to learn through disorientation. Like many colleagues, I began graduate school in a place I’d never been before and where I knew no one.

    My application statement submitted to UBC in January 2021:
    I am a renaissance student whose skills in the arts and sciences unite in Geographic Information Science. My research interests lie in GeoVisualization, Critical Cartography, and the Geohumanities. I value both qualitative and quantitative methodologies, and am especially drawn to the ways both practices supplement each other. The research streams Digital Geographies, Geospatial Analysis, GIS and Knowledge, Ideas, Practices are both of interest to me for I seek the technical skills to map transdisciplinary patterns, not just conceptualize them. While my undergraduate background is in the physical sciences, I am fundamentally a creative whose passion lies with critical examinations of people, their interaction with each other, and response to the natural and built environment.

As teaching assistant for a departmental cartography course, I was responsible for introducing and evaluating assignments, as well as demonstrating the use of required software. The first assignment: to make a map of downtown Vancouver by tracing a screenshot from Google Maps in Adobe Illustrator. I graded sixty of these maps before I finally ventured to the place they represented. Having now inhabited Vancouver for nearly two years and taught this assignment nine times, I find Google’s basemap incongruous with my mental map of the city drawn from lived experience. Navigational maps, writes Laura Kurgan, “impos[e] a quiet tyranny of orientation that erases the possibility of disoriented discovery. . .” (2009, 16-17). 


Tyranny of orientation/fixation of trace: Flat maps, Navigational Maps (Kurgan, de Certeau)
> "It seems as though in the end, maps —the successful ones, the ones that show us where we are and get us from here to there —risk offering only two alternatives. They let us see too much, and hence blind us to what we cannot see, imposing a quiet tyranny of orientation that erases the possibility of disoriented discovery, or they lose sight of all the other things that we ought to see. They omit, according to their conventions, those *invisible lines of people, places, and networks that create the most common spaces we live in today.*" (Laura Kurgan, 16-17 from Close up and at a distance, emphasis mine)

>"It is true that the operations of walking on can be traced on city maps in such a way as to transcribe their paths (here well-trodden, there very faint) and their trajectories (going this way and not that). But these thick or thin curves only refer, like words, to the absence of what has passed by. Surveys of routes miss what was: the act itself of passing by. The operation of walking, wandering, or "window shopping," that is, the activity of passers-by, is transformed into points that draw a totalizing and reversible line on the map. They allow us to grasp only a relic set in the nowhen of a surface of projection. Itself visible, it has the effect of making invisible the operation that made it possible. These fixations constitute procedures for forgetting. The trace left behind is substituted for the practice. It exhibits the (voracious) property that the geographical system has of being able to transform action into legibility, but in doing so it causes a way of being in the world to be forgotten." (de Certeau 1984, 97)

Spatial awareness of my surroundings has evolved not by following Google Maps from A to B or memorizing its aerial contours, but rather through becoming lost and wandering around. Thus disoriented, I find areas of familiarity connected in surprising ways.

[Navigations, Exploration, and the performative iteration which articulates a field ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/negative-spaces/negative-spaces.github.io/main/mindpalace/navigations.txt)

I realize the city is not a fixed and inherently bounded object which pre-exists my encounter and which I, the geographer-researcher, may separate myself from in order to map from a distanced, exterior position. Rather, the city is physical-conceptual field whose emergent topology is performatively constituted through my everyday navigations. 

What if the field were not  a site separate from where spatial analyses are produced, maps rendered, and urban geography written? Bringing this orientation to the ground, as praxis, means assuming the field of encounter (the city, as encountered if you will) as interlocutor. 

I invoke **research-creation** to initiate such a dialogue with the world, asking
```
What could it mean to think *with* place, to *feel* the city?
