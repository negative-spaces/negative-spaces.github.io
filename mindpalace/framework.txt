Structural organization: sections will be grouped under DEEP MAPPING as CONSTRUCTIVE INTERFERENCE a) with the basemap b) with established forms of knowledge production c) with accepted ways of rendering research public 
    {  d) maybe something about rhythms, time, and iteration through theory and practice, though this can be covered in b)

Multiple navigations will be offered which guide the interlocutor through sections contained within the above groupings in unique pathways. 

    With the basemap (critical cartography, embodied ways of knowing place), with established forms of knowledge production (practice based, slow scholarship, process orinted, time, metrics), with acceted ways of rendering research (research creation and creative outputs talk about space) 


Prologue
    over-view - small scale - introductory sweep of project
    see ./prologue.txt

FIELD 
    see ./field.txt
    Situating self in place (vancouver) --> point of orign (0,0) 
    EXPANDED FIELD
    Fieldwork --> practice 
    Probematising The City as noun/subject/field --> de Certeau
    Situate within disciplinary field --> transdisciplinary? polydisciplinary (loveless)
        Creative Humanities, Geohumanities, Cartography, Geography, Digital Geography - 

NAVIGATIONS 
    of site, of field, of concepts 
    iterative loops
        through theory and practice
    enacting slow scholarship/revalorizing process --> journey/navigation is a site of learning
    research creation --> my work practice based rather than practice led bc generating knwoledge from creative practice
    or put this in b)
    Following curiosity --> Lure

DEEP MAPPING as CONSTRUCTIVE INTERFERENCE with the BASEMAP
    THE BASEMAP
        see basemap.txt
        Critical cartography of basemap, 2D, flattened. 
            Google maps, "tyranny of orientation" (Kurgan)
                    
        Theorizing from the bridge, from the plaza --> scale, perspective, context
            Certeau on Walking in the city chapter:
                "His eleveation transfigures him into a voyeur... It puts him at a distance. It ransforms the bewitching world by which one was "posessed" into a text that lies before one's eyes. It allows one to read it, to be a solar Eye, looking down like a god. The exaltation of a scopic and gnostic drive: the fiction of knowledge is related to this lust to be a viewpoint and nothing more." (92)

                ..."Escaping the imaginary totalizations produced by the eye, the everyday has a certain strangeness that does not surface, or whose surface is only the upper limit, outlining itself against the visible." (93)

                >In the chapter Certeau outlines practices outside/counter to geometrical, panoptic, visual geographies and theoretical constructions... Beyond the surfice of the 2D aerial view of the city. 

                >Map --> tool of spatial/urban rhetoric

            Segway to deep mapping through de Certeau's footsteps --> practices of space 

    BEYOND THE BASEMAP (beyond the monochrome)
        cartographies beyond the basemap - maps and mapping practices that counter cartesian conventions by orienting towards embodied ways of knowing place
                Briefly review counter cartographies

                (cite magrane, cresswell, d leeuw, aaker, gurney, calvino, bonnet, hand drawn maps, larissa fassler, disorientation guides; maps that use software creatively â†’ Enfolding for example, feral atlas, atlas of radical geographies etc)

        Deep Mapping: bring in literature and outline my practice as I draw from psychogeography and rhythmanalysis
        Field notes etc. will be separate page, but throughout text I will link to note or expressly articulate how concept/connection/idea came to me while deep mapping - from thinking WITH the field. 

DEEP MAPPING as CONSTRUCTIVE INTERFERENCE with ESTABLISHED FORMS of KNOWLEDGE PRODUCTION

    TACTICS (vs. strategies (de certeau) --> alternative methods) Citing all those on methods, modes, materials
    (ways of being, operating, modes of doing, eclectic methodologicalism and spatial/bricolage)
    neurodivergence, intuition, lure, drive, derive, contour, affect, sensorium
    SLOW SCHOLARSHIP
    PRAXIS based
        my work practice based rather than practice led bc generating knowledge  from creative practice

DEEP MAPPING as CONSTRUCTIVE INTERFERENCE with ACCEPTED WAYS OF RENDERING RESEARCH (PUBLIC)
    
    RESEARCH-CREATION
    deep mapping as research-creation 

    MAKING SPACE 
        about this space
        making do/learning through doing
        revalorizing process --> commit history
        spatiality of git
