        What does it mean to think with place? To feel the city? My research is a praxis-based investigation into how the city as a field of encounter is constituted through everyday navigations. It explores how deep mapping––a practice of situated, embodied inhabitation––generates practical knowledge of an urban geography. Thinking together/with the material-geographical and neural-conceptual fields of my encounter, I theorize deep mapping as constructive interference with flat maps, established forms of knowledge production, and institutionally accepted forms of rendering research public.

        Deep mapping assumes the city as interlocutor. My work is research-creation for the questions I ask  “set[] up a dialogue with the world” and are driven by intellectual and spatial topoi which lure me forwards even before I comprehend where they lead (Loveless 2019, 95). So grasped am I by the city’s rhythms I become Lefebvre’s rhythmanalyst (2013). Pressing my chest against the Granville Bridge I feel at once its trembling vibration and my own heart’s rapid beating. My body in visceral contact with that of the city––its infrastructure––I embody for some duration the city’s rhythm. My concept of deep mapping as constructive interference came to me while breathing with the ocean. The day was grey, but at my feet I noticed foam forming bubbles on whose surface spun psychedelic spirals. This happens due to thin film interference, where light waves reflecting off the surface are interfered with by waves which have entered the film and re-emerge as refracted light. When refracted waves align with those reflected, they interfere constructively, intensifying the wavelength of light to make visible an abundance of colors. Deep mapping is constructive interference with the superficial reflection that is place rendered down from above by flat maps. Deep mapping does not counter cartography; it is not defined by opposition so much as through acts of iterative intervention. It is thus a diffractive methodology (Barad 2007), a practice “that elude[s] discipline without being outside the field in which it is exercised” (de Certeau 1984, 98). My research valorizes ways of being and operating in the world (and academy) which cartesian cartography––a manifestation of “the (voracious) property that the geographical system has of being able to transform action into legibility” (de Certeau 1984, 97)––relegates to negative space, to other than the intelligible subject, to outside the field.

        Deep mapping interferes constructively with such voracity by refusing operationalization. My output renders knowledge generated through practice not practice itself. It takes shape in negative-spaces.github.io, a digital space whose form resembles the rhizomatic process of research-creation and the interconnectedness of my points of reference. Negative-spaces.github.io refocuses attention (from) within the field. The journey becomes foreground and what counts in/as research is expanded. In both research and creation I employ tactics of bricolage––the poetics of making do with what tools, skills, and materials are around (Roberts 2018). Tactics are methods whose validity is measured by their applicability to the situation at hand (de Certeau 1984). Practical knowledge. For instance, instead of learning everything about coding and styling webpages before building my web-site, I teach myself what I need as I go, often gleaning (copypasting) snippets of open source code (as is custom) that are relevant to what I am attempting in the moment. Indeed, it is through my job at the library––assisting in geospatial information and technology––that I learned to command the version control software I write with (git), and internet hosting service which renders visible my work (GitHub).
