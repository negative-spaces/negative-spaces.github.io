      <p style="text-align: center;"><b>INTERFERENCE</b></p>
      Some grey day last winter I walked the stretch of shoreline that wraps around the traditional, ancestral, unceded territory of the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam) First Nations. I am here because from where the sand turns dry begins the land occupied by the University of British Columbia. With the Salish sea on one side and a forest of evergreens and sword ferns to the other, the university at which I am a graduate student is geographically and administratively separated from the city of Vancouver. The beach is the only spot on campus I can breathe easily, where I can think. A five minute walk from the Geography Department takes me to a zig-zag staircase at the bottom of which awaits a place where clothing is optional. My shoes and socks are the first to come off. The sand is cold and firm, yet porous. It holds the impression of my soles and reshapes in my hands. I contain it for a moment - appreciating the texture worn from time and force - then release it. 
    <br><br>
    Sunshine was a precious thing my first winter settled in Vancouver when it rained for four months straight. The cloud cover was so dense that a dimple of white was the only indication our star remained. Monochrome days used to really kill my vibe. There’s a dullness to a landscape lit ambiently, a non-differentiation that makes it difficult to articulate thoughts. That day I paused at ocean’s edge where barnacles encrust the rocks and molluscs cling together in crunchy bundles. In and out rolled the waves, and I breathed with them. On each exhale I noticed how foam gathered around the rocks at my feet, forming bubbles on whose surface spun psychedelic spirals. This happens due to thin film interference, where light waves reflecting off the surface of a bubble are interfered with by waves which have been transmitted through the film, reflected back, and refracted at the surface at the angle of incidence.

    When refracted waves are shifted so as to be in-synch with those reflected, they interfere constructively to make visible an abundance of colors. Deep mapping is interference with the superficial reflection that is place rendered (down) by flat maps.
