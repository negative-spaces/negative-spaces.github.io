  <p>This section describes the tactics of deep mapping and why an eclectic toolkit of methods gleaned from what’s already around is best suited to interference. Tactics are methods whose validity is measured by their applicability to the situation at hand. Beginning with de Certeau’s differentiation of tactics and strategies, I argue that spatial analysis with geographic information systems (GIS) deploys strategy while deep mapping employs tactics. GIS are the computational programs, desktop applications, and infrastructural hardware that facilitate the distribution, visualization, and analysis of spatial phenomenon. Coordinates append location to place, codifying the city into vector graphics and pixel grids. Vertical negotiations are rendered down and rent apart into layers like streets.shp, waterbodies.tiff, and buildings.geojson. Even when every layer is added to the screen one atop the other, their sum remains an impalpable expanse. Deep mapping is a spatial practice of situated, embodied inhabitation which assumes the physical-conceptual field of encounter as interlocutor. Empirics emerge as inextricable layerings of sensorium, affect, and infrastructure through synesthetic attunement to the entangled viscera of urban bodies, human and nonhuman. Questions brought up in this section that I would explore further in another project are: How are empirics made legible as data by the apparatuses that produce them? How are technoscientific and affective orientations to ‘what counts as data’ constitutive an empirical account of the city? For now I return to the eclectic toolkit of the bricoleur-as-researcher and the tactics involved enacting my interference as praxis: in data collection (engaging with my surroundings), making data legible as research imperics (producing geographic knowledge), and c/si(gh)ting otherwise (rendering spatial research public). I trace patterns between “gleaning as spatial praxis,” practical knowledge and computational thinking. Draw from conversation between Foucault and Deleuze on Intellectuals and Power to demonstrate theory as a toolkit of tactics for transgression.

    Strategies vs Tactics <br>
    Tactics are methods whose validity is measured by their applicability to the situation at hand (de Certeau 1984)<br>
    - GIS deploys strategy (cf jon goss) while deep mapping employs tactics
  </p>
  
<p>
  [gleaning, bricolage, making do]
</p>

  <p>
    The eclectic toolkit of a bricoleur is needed to expand the field from within, interfering with systems and structures which delimit intelligibility not through oppositional strategies but with tactics appropriate to the situation at hand.

<p>Generative Exercises (for when things feel stuck), a list to add to 
	-walk the alley with a medium (voice recorder, sketchbook, camera, etc) 
	-go outside and map something with paper and pen; map it again differently 
-choose one concept and free write for 20 minutes about it
-mindmap with sticky notes on the wall
-draw with chalk 
-write while sitting in a different location, with a change of view
-perform a dérive for a day 
-exchange ideas with a friend over coffee
-ride the bus without destination 
-hand-map something small scale and something large scale
-from a plaza or rooftop parkade, look down to the street and observe what flows below 
-stand midway across a bridge and observe movement in all dimensions 
-remain at an intersection for 10 minutes and notice what patterns and disruptions emerge </p>
