        <b>DISORIENTATION</b>
        <br><br><br><br>
      I have come to understand being a geographer as less of an ability to know where you are in space at all times and more of a capacity to learn through disorientation. Like many colleagues, I began graduate school in a place I’d never been before and where I didn’t really know anyone. 
      As teaching assistant for a departmental cartography course, I was responsible for introducing and evaluating assignments, as well as demonstrating the use of required software. The first assignment: to make a map of downtown Vancouver by tracing a screenshot from Google Maps in Adobe Illustrator. I graded sixty of these maps before I finally ventured to the place they represented. Having now inhabited Vancouver for two years and taught this assignment nine times, I find Google’s basemap incongruous with my mental map of the city drawn from practical experience. Navigational maps, writes Laura Kurgan, “impos[e] a quiet tyranny of orientation that erases the possibility of disoriented discovery. . .” (2009, 16-17).

      Spatial awareness of my surroundings has evolved not by following Google's Map from A to B or memorizing the trace of its aerial contours, but rather through becoming lost and wandering around. Thus disoriented, I find areas of familiarity connected in surprising ways. . .

          I take the 33 bus to campus on a whim. I'm running late to teach and I don't want to deal with the hassle of Broadway construction. Why have I never taken the 33? I wonder as a 5 minute walk brings me to a deserted stop. I sit on a bench in the sun to catch my breath a moment. The 33 is one of the smaller buses. Its seats have that soft fabric patterned like a roller rink carpet. Riding the 33 is outside my routine. Its route takes me through places I've been before but have never connected in this way. I write these thoughts in the white space of a book I brought with me - <i>A History of My Brief Body</i> by Billy-Ray Belcourt. <br><br>
      Each time I leave home I bring along the people/stories/theories I wish to think with for the day. Often, I bring more than one book. I put texts into conversation first amongst themselves. In my bag, their pages interlap, folding together like a pair of hands bookmarking one another. Opening one, I open myself: Read through me. Transform me. <!--diffraction! -->
          <br><br>
          More recently I boarded the 99 B-Line with Critical Concepts for the Creative Humanities which I brought because each concept is a 4 page read - the time it takes to ride 2 stops along Broadway. It opens in my lap to where I'd hastily tucked an IKEA crayon. A page I to a page I'd never before been: Navigations. 
          <br><br>
          <i>"...navigation entails the production of a performative cartography of a terrain, field, or domain that is constituted in the very act of its exploration"</i> (Tuin and Verhoeff 2022, 137-139).
          <br><br>
          Exploration, put one way, is <a href="https://bit.ly/3XeFxZw">"the action of traveling in or through an unfamiliar area in order to learn about it."</a> Though the field (city, body of academic literature) is at first unknown and therefore unfamiliar,   <a href="edies/iteration.html">iterative </a> navigation coheres a mental map of  a web of relations that serve as reference. This is how I conceive of a mental maps, drawn of "those invisible lines of people, places, and networks that create the most common spaces we live in today" (Kurgan 2013, 17). 
          <br><br>
          [getting to wise 3 ways- main street shifting as i moved closer to it and also grasped a better understanding of city  through navs. Connected places multiple modes of transport - even hill and bus]
          <br>
        </div>
      <br>       
      The city is not a fixed bounded site which pre-exists my encounter as geographer-researcher and which I may separate myself from in order to map from a distanced, exterior position. Rather, the city is a physical-conceptual field of encounter whose emergent topology is performatively constituted through my everyday navigations. As such, the city and I - field and researcher - are entangled, continuously figured in dynamic relation. 
    <br><br>
        <i>Bring back to maps, traces, questioning field and fieldwork - everyday practices like commute as fieldsite - talk aimlessness or getting lost learning through disorientation slow scholarship - bricoleur as researcher. set up questions - what could it mean to think with place, feel the city. but dont get into theory or practice yet. </i>
