# Deep Mapping Theory As Praxis

 What could it mean to think <i>with</i> place? To <i>feel</i> the city? I explore and respond to these questions through deep mapping, or situated, embodied inhabitation as a practice of ongoing and open-ended dialogue with the world. Deep mapping is not defined by opposition so much as articulated through iterative acts of interference with hegemonic forms of representing place, producing geographic knowledge, and rendering spatial research public. This is my theory, at least. My master's research-creation amounts to cultivating a practice of deep mapping, theorizing my interpretation of this capacious practice <i>through</i> practice, and enacting my theory as praxis. 
    

I submit as my thesis a zip folder whose contents comprise a website where text and multimedia are integrated together. To enter, first download the release `ubc_2024_november_crandalloral_lilydemet_negative-spaces.zip` and unzip it. You can do this either by double clicking the file, or control-clicking it and choosing to unzip with a compression software. Once unzipped, enter the folder negative-spaces. Control-click (right-click) the file index.html  and "open with" your default web browser. Negative-spaces employs form as a tactic for refiguring the boundaries of intelligibility around what counts as a thesis, as fieldwork, and as intellecting others (viz., interlocutors). In my research practice, which includes the creation of this site, am guided by slow scholarship and bricolage as a necessary self-accommodation as much as an interference with dominant economies of knowledge production and publication. What is rendered here is not a substitution for practice. Rather, negative-spaces sites a partial account of an ongoing interference praxis.
