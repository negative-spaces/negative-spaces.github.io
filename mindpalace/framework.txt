ON ORGANIZATION of
    CONTENT
        Structural organization: sections will be grouped under DEEP MAPPING as CONSTRUCTIVE INTERFERENCE a) with the flat map b) with established forms of knowledge production c) with accepted ways of rendering research public 
    FORM
        Multiple navigations will be offered which guide the interlocutor through differing pathways amongst sections contained within the above groupings. In this way the form of this project accounts for the non-linear process which brings it into (iterative) being. 
    
    
Orientation
    see ./orientation.txt
        over-view: small scale glance at endeavor's motivation, aims, contribution, as well as interjections & responses within disciplinary conversations and general situated-ness of researcher and work.
        How we tell stories matters (Haraway) - Many stories exist within the landscape (Jericho Beach). Some books grasp you. This thesis is inspired by (Invisible Cities and Rhythmanalysis). 


FIELD
    see ./field.txt
    introducing the fields of my encounter; problematizing The City as a noun. Discussing the expanded field as it pertains to my work. Situating self in disciplinary relation. Describing what my fieldwork is and my commitments in praxis.

NAVIGATIONS 
    see ./navigations.txt
        Explain the form/ation of my research derived from iterative loops through theory and practice. What is it I mean by "thinking with the fields of my encounter"? How does deep mapping as practice based geography, as research-creation, bring into intersection the conceptual and geographical fields? The structure and organization of this space is outlined with suggestions for navigation.

deep mapping as CONSTRUCTIVE INTERFERENCE with the FLAT MAP
    The Basemap
        see ./basemap.txt
        Drawing on personal experience of orienting myself here and teaching cartography I critique flat maps as representative of inhabited, embodied experience. How else can place be rendered? Then I offer cartographies beyond the basemap - maps and mapping practices that counter cartesian conventions by orienting towards embodied ways of knowing place. After reviewing critical, creative cartographies, I differentiate deep mapping (as a practice) from "counter cartography." With time, I'd like to elaborate on deep mapping as counter conduct, transgression. Deep mapping as I conceive of it does not counter cartography. It is not defined by opposition so much as through acts of iterative intervention.

    Flat maps, physical or digital, render traces of movement but not motion itself (de Certeau on footsteps; form drawing quote). 

         "a form drawing is a present record of a past movement, the remaining trace of a finished gesture." (Gerbert 1987, 9)

         "It is true that the operations of walking on can be traced on city maps in such a way as to transcribe their paths (here well-trodden, there very faint) and their trajectories (going this way and not that). But these thick or thin curves only refer, like words, to the absence of what has passed by...They allow us to grasp only a relic set in the nowhen of a surface of projection. Itself visible, it has the effect of making invisible the operation that made it possible. These fixations constitute procedures for forgetting. The trace left behind is substituted for the practice. It exhibits the (voracious) property that the geographical system has of being able to transform action into legibility, but in doing so it causes a way of being in the world to be forgotten." (de Certeau,1984, 97)

deep mapping as CONSTRUCTIVE INTERFERENCE with ESTABLISHED FORMS of KNOWLEDGE PRODUCTION 
    see tactics.txt  knowledge-production.txt constructive-interference.txt
        Tactics --> Practical knowledge 

    TACTICS
    See tactics.txt
        Why tactics? Drawing from de Certeau's differentiation between Tactics and Strategies.
        (ways of being, operating, modes of doing, eclectic methodologicalism and spatial/bricolage)
        tactics relevent to me --> what kinds of things i do as fieldwork 

        Walking/Drift
        
        bricoleur-as-researcher (vs. researcher-as-bricoleur)
        Bricolage: Making do; gleaning (informal economy!! alleys, shoes

        Tactics, Bricolage connection to Practical Knowledge:
            Scott (315):
                "Adapting quickly and well to unpredictable events ...and making the best out of limited re- sources are the kinds of skills that are hard to teach as cut-and-dried disciplines."
                
                "innovations of metis will typically represent a recombination (bricolage, to use Lkvi-Strauss's term)40of existing elements;" (324)

                "The power of practical knowledge depends on an exceptionally close and astute observation of the environment"

            >intuition, lure, drive, derive, contour, affect, sensorium
                "It [metis] is the mode of reasoning most appropriate to complex material and social tasks where the un- certainties are so daunting that we must trust our (experienced) intu- ition and feel our way. " (Scott 1998,327)
            >neurodivergence in space (computational thinking (abstractions, patterns, possible 
            paths, algorithm), troubleshooting)
            >being neruodivergent --> aquiring practical knowledge; requiring tactics
        
        Then, I show how the tactics themselves, methodological eclecticism required challenges accepted forms of knowledge production. modes of "doing" "fieldwork." And how in so doing I am enacting otherwise. Bridging Practice/ Praxis divides. Practice based research --> connects to section on rendering research public.

Intervention: Weaving place beyond the monochrome
    Summarize my project, its contribution, commitments, and aims manifested.

    Deep mapping :: research-creation :: constructive interference :: diffraction :: transformation through encounter, two waves (rhythms) are spatiotemporally aligned and in so being alter and are altered by one another producing a new wave (subject/object, researcher/field, Lily/City). Feeling the City. 

    Deep mapping as slow scholarship in praxis
        Deep mapping is an exercise in slow scholarship: it takes time to know a place, to follow curiosity, to become lost. Light waves which penetrate the surface of a bubble take longer to re-emerge than those which reflect (off) the surface. Process-oriented.
