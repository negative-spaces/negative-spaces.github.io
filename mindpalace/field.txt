The Field
        Situating self --> point of orign (0,0) 

        Expanded Field (Ian Cook)
         "..writing your 'self' through the 'expanded field' in your work can be justified 'academically' as a way of writing relexive, multi-locale ethnography. 

        Expanded Field (Rosalind Krauss): 42

            "The expanded field which characterizes this domain of postmodernism possesses two features that are already implicit in the above description. One of these concerns the practice of individual artists; the other has to do with the question of medium. At both these points the bounded conditions of modernism have suffered a logically determined rupture.
            
            With regard to individual practice, it is easy to see that many of the artists in question have found themselves occupying, successively, different places within the expanded field. And though the experience of the field suggests that this continual relocation of one's energies is entirely logical, an art criticism still in the thrall of a modernist ethos has been largely suspicious of such movement, calling it eclectic. This suspicion of a career that moves continually and erratically beyond the domain of sculpture obviously derives from the modernist demand for the purity and separateness of the various mediums (and thus the necessary special- ization of a practitioner within a given medium). But what appears as eclectic from one point of view can be seen as rigorously logical from another. For, within the situation of postmodernism, practice is not defined in relation to a given medium-sculpture-but rather in relation to the logical operations on a set of cultural terms, for which any medium-photography, books, lines on walls, mirrors, or sculpture itself-might be used."


            Krauss diagrams the expanded field of which sculpture is but a peripheral locus by constructing a paiget group from sculpture as a "combination of exclusions": not-landscape and not-architecture.

            ^^ model can be applied to coming to know a field (city) measured through ability to navigate without a (non mental) map --> stages follow. 
            the same mathemeatical model Krause uses to perorm a logical expansion on the field of sculpture is used in mapping spatial cognition...?!
    
        "The City" as a proper noun problematized (de Certeau)
            Probematising The City as noun/subject/field --> de Certeau
                The "city" produced by "flattening out of all the data in a plane projection"; impose "nowhen" - time
                ""The city," like a proper name, thus provides a way of conceiving and constructing space on the basis of a finite number of stable, isolatable, and interconnected properties." (94)
                ...
                "Finally, the functionalist organizaiton, by priviledging progress (i.e., time), causes the condition of its own possibility–-space itself––to be forgotten; space thus becomes the blind spot in a scientific and political technology."

                >Urban efficiency equated to time. But in practice the diagonal is not always the most efficient way to cross an intersection though the crosswalk is drawn so. As GT said: "inefficiency as praxis". Question "efficiency" --> who benefits from shortening time?

                ... certeau continues on to "analyze the microbe-like, singular and plural practices which an urbanistic system was supposed to administer or supress, but which have outlived its decay; ....far from being regulated or eliminated by panoptic administration, have reinforced themselves in a proliferating illegitimacy... unreadable but stable tactics to the point of constituting everyday regulations and surreptitious creativities..."
         The site is not separate from where research is written up → challenging method of travelling a great distance to the field and then returning to institution to write up knowledge from field notes

What is my field? What is my fieldwork?
    Fieldwork (speculative) 
     My practice takes place in the city of Vancouver and UBC campus, my writing in and around the city - sometimes inside often outside when the sun shines.

Situate within disciplinary field --> transdisciplinary? polydisciplinary (loveless)
        Creative Humanities, Geohumanities, Cartography, Geography, Digital Geography - 

Examples of thinking with the field:
    Detour on the bus --> idea about navigations/connections/emergence of framework (mental map)
    Abstract --> Concrete
        Drawing with chalk on sidewalk as bricolage, transoforming the pedestrian 
    Constructive interference --> expanding the monochrome
