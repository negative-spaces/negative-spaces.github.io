compare AAG and symposium for sites of interference and tactics (DIFF omg doing what i did was a tactic -) but also CBD - no alley entrance

Presentation - rendering spatial research public - becomes a tactic site of interference 
WOW the presentation of the research was part of the reasearch practice ---- make interference with research (diffraction) then study interferences made and patterns of simmilarity and diffrernece across them (diffractive apparatus revealing diffractive pattens) this is how deep mapping is diffraction
-- negative space - site constantly changing shifting boundary of intelligibile form limit of intelligibility 

when i say i think iwth place i mean to situated myself within the boundary making practice of my investigation that produces the concepts I theorize with,  configures and reconfigures the topology of the city as a performative process of navigation (citation?), and differntially defines bodies 


<!--While academic geographers and urban planners may theorize and design city places, urban space is performatively constituted through the everyday spatial practices of inhabitants whose navigations both cultivate and deploy practical, experiential knowledge. ← thinking WITH place - feeling city is rhythmic. Thinking with place is spatial awareness --> 

to explain superposition - diffraction - do a diffractive mapping of aag and symposium presentations. this applys y theoretical analytic (interated into coherence and never quite finished) to sites of praxis 

-- end on this note , superposiiton, and diffracitve mapping after explained dm practice theory, praxis, interference, situated knowledges, etc. its going to be absolutely epic.

Walking alleyways, I glean treasures and balcony imaginaries. I track the dispersion and defacement of graffiti tags and sticker signs like *below, 15 minute city ready (and the superimposed scrawl, RESIST), and a new imperative: FIND THE DRIFT // CROSS // THE FENCE REPORT // ALL SIGNS*. I explore commercial dumpsters as sites of implosion and assemblage, attending to ephemeral stories arising from the odor of urban excrement.

Journey. A nonlinear process of wayfinding along the course of which the point of departure and destination are refigured. To navigate the field of possibilities opened up when A and B are recognized to be but place holders like latitude and longitude. The iteration of a form reveals beginning and end to be merely places of turning and return. I have come to understand being a geographer as less of an ability to know where you are in space at all times and more the capacity to learn through disorientation. 

 <!--SIDE NOTES Releasing the certain destination in favor of disoriented discovery creates space and time to experiment in unpredictable Research-creation follows desire, and builds spaces and contexts that allow the time and space to experiment in unpredictable directions. " (70 )-->
My research-creation is driven by intellectual and spatial topoi which lure me forwards even before I comprehend where they lead(1). What could it mean to think *with* place, to *feel* the city? Approaching the field of encounter as interlocutor, I initiate an ongoing and open-ended dialogue with my surroundings through deep mapping, a practice of situated, embodied inhabitation.  
My thesis is about deep mapping, my practice, theorization through practice, and enactment of theory as praxis. 





 journey to Vancouver and to my thesis project, acknowledging the disorientation inherent to exploration and the navigation of an at first unfamiliar terrain. Whether urban or conceptual, I argue that familiarity develops nonlinearly through connections made while lost and wandering around. Reflecting on my experience developing spatial awareness of a new place while teaching cartography, I trouble delineations of the city as a fixed and inherently bounded object which pre-exists my encounter and which I, the geographer-researcher, may separate myself from in order to map from a distanced, exterior position. Rather, the city is a physical-conceptual field whose emergent topology is performatively constituted through my everyday navigations. As such, the city and I are figured and refigured in relation, a continuous tranformation that is never quite complete. If this process forms my research interest, where do I locate my fieldsite? And what constitutes my fieldwork? Answering these questions opens an investigation into where/how the boundaries around what counts as intelligible forms of knowledge production and legible ways of rendering research in academia are drawn as well as transgressed. What is at stake in interfering from within - in s/citing differently? I think through these questions while riding the bus, walking the bridge, presenting my research at a conference and to my department. 

 I find answers along the way, often by way of serendipitous encounters arising from spontaneous detours. 
 

 
 
 
 Iteratively enacted as a praxis of interference, I articulate how deep mapping not only marks where the boundaries of intelligibility are drawn but refigures them, valorizing ways of being and operating in the world (and academy) which are systemically relegated to negative space, to that whose othered existence is necessary for upholding the definition of the intelligible form. The site for deep mapping is therefore evershifting and no one methodological strategy will suffice. An eclectic toolkit is needed - the bricleur --> serendipity piece.   Deep mapping is thus a commitment to expanding the field from within, to interfering with systems and structures which serve to of through oppositional strategies but tactics of interference. Its all the field for deep mapping.             

  Following  a concept in multiple directions I find myself making surprising connections. Mapping deeply is process oriented. It enacts slow scholarship thru care-full relating to self and others, human and nonhuman. Deep mapping does not render down to a deep map. Neither, however, does it counter cartography. From my iteration through theory and practice by which I weave together the physical and conceptual fields of my encounter, I offer an interpretation of deep mapping that serves for now, for this project: *deep mapping is a praxis of interference with hegemonic forms of engaging & representing place, producing geographic knowledge, and rendering spatial research public.*

**What is here rendered visible is a story of marks made by interference and how they come to matter.**

My practice of deep mapping generates interference patterns; My thesis, what's assembled and rendered visible here, is the story of how my interferences come to matter in the form of a theorization constituted through practice. Discussing similarities and differences between two presentations of my research-creation (AAG and symposium), I articulate how deep mapping not only marks where the boundaries of intelligibility are drawn but assumes takes them as the site for interference, refigures them to valorizing ways of being and operating in the world (and academy) which are systemically relegated to negative space, to that whose othered existence is necessary for upholding the definition of the intelligible form.
In the "end," however, I will posit praxis as a superposition of theory and practice, and with discussion of 


. My theory of deep mapping as interference is constituted (comes to matter) through my practice. 

Through practice I  through iterative acts of practice was the generating interference. thesis text  story of how they came to matter. 
but, end will show praxis (practice my theorization of deep mapping) as superposition. dm becomes both at once in form of the thesis output. ooooooooooooooooo. genius.
