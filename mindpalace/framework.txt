Structural organization: sections will be grouped under DEEP MAPPING as CONSTRUCTIVE INTERFERENCE a) with the basemap b) with established forms of knowledge production c) with accepted ways of rendering research public 
    {  d) maybe something about rhythms, time, and iteration through theory and practice, though this can be covered in b)

Multiple navigations will be offered which guide the interlocutor through sections contained within the above groupings in unique pathways. 

    With the basemap (critical cartography, embodied ways of knowing place), with established forms of knowledge production (practice based, slow scholarship, process orinted, time, metrics), with acceted ways of rendering research (research creation and creative outputs talk about space) 


Prologue
    over-view - small scale - introductory sweep of project
    see ./deep-mapping.txt

FIELD 
    EXPANDED FIELD
    Fieldwork
 
NAVIGATIONS 
    of site, of field, of concepts 

    iterative loops
        through theory and practice

    enacting slow scholarship/revalorizing process --> journey/navigation is a site of learning

    research creation --> my work practice based rather than practice led bc generating knwoledge from creative practice
    or put this in b)

    Lure? 

DEEP MAPPING as CONSTRUCTIVE INTERFERENCE with the BASEMAP

    THE BASEMAP
        maybe move autoethnography of TAing cartography here, or flush out further. 
        Critical cartography of basemap, 2D, flattened. 
            Google maps, "tyranny of orientation" (Kurgan)
        Theorizing from the bridge, from the plaza --> perspective, context

    BEYOND THE BASEMAP (beyond the monochrome)
        cartographies beyond the basemap - maps and mapping practices that counter cartesian conventions by orienting towards embodied ways of knowing place

                https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lJPhC2g=/
                (cite magrane, cresswell, d leeuw, aaker, gurney, calvino, bonnet, hand drawn maps, larissa fassler, disorientation guides; maps that use software creatively â†’ Enfolding for example, feral atlas, atlas of radical geographies etc)

        Deep Mapping: bring in literature and outline my practice as I draw from psychogeography and rhythmanalysis
        Field notes etc. will be separate page, but throughout text I will link to note or expressly articulate how concept/connection/idea came to me while deep mapping - from thinking WITH the field. 

DEEP MAPPING as CONSTRUCTIVE INTERFERENCE with ESTABLISHED FORMS of KNOWLEDGE PRODUCTION

    TACTICS (vs. strategies --> alternative methods) Citing all those on methods, modes, materials
    (ways of being, operating, modes of doing, eclectic methodologicalism and spatial/bricolage)
    neurodivergence, intuition, lure, drive, derive, contour, affect, sensorium
    SLOW SCHOLARSHIP
    PRAXIS based
        my work practice based rather than practice led bc generating knwoledge from creative practice

DEEP MAPPING as CONSTRUCTIVE INTERFERENCE with ACCEPTED WAYS OF RENDERING RESEARCH (PUBLIC)
    
    RESEARCH-CREATION
    deep mapping as research-creation 

    MAKING SPACE 
        about this space
        making do/learning through doing
        revalorizing process --> commit history
        spatiality of git
