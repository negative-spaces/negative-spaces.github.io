        LEARNING THROUGH DISORIENTATION
        <br><br> <br>
        <a name="learning-through-disorientation" id="learning-through-disorientation"></a>
        I have come to understand being a geographer as less of an ability to know where you are in space at all times and more of a capacity to learn through disorientation. Like many colleagues, I began graduate school in a place I’d never been before and where I didn’t really know anyone. As teaching assistant for a departmental cartography course, I was responsible for introducing and evaluating assignments, as well as demonstrating the use of required software. The first assignment: to make a map of downtown Vancouver by tracing a screenshot from Google Maps in Adobe Illustrator. I graded sixty of these maps before I finally ventured to the place they represented.

        My first excursion downtown was in December of 2021, six months after I'd arrived in Vancouver. I took the 7 from Dunbar all the way to the waterfront. This took about an hour - one reason downtown seemed so distant and therefore inaccessible from the rest of the city. I was stuck on a term paper and figured disorientation might help. It did. I got off the bus somewhere by the shipyard and found a bridge (an infrastructure which has supported me since then). The following became the Prologue to that term paper:
        <br><br>
        <span class="quote" style="height:230px; overflow:scroll">Where Main Street ends, at the boundary between Gastown and the Downtown Eastside, there is a bridge. Well it’s more of a ramp really that curls around so the road never ends but continues by a different name in a new direction. I found myself there the other morning, standing alone just gazing towards the North Shore Mountains. It was clear and cold and snow had settled over their jagged peaks in a perfect gradient. Before the mountains and directly below me spread a panoply of infrastructure––Vancouver’s Centennial Terminals. Tower cranes, gantry cranes, straddle carriers, forklifts, trucks, trains, train tracks, shipping containers, and pipes of iron and steel. Every dimension was in motion. Machinery moved slowly and methodically while humans moved in erratic zig-zags around the pavement. Some were operating the machinery while some machinery were operating themselves. As a train drew in below me I peered down to see the conductor watching the switchboard, prepared to take action in the event of system failure. But what happens when the train is your argument and it fails to budge along the tracks you’ve set out for it to follow? In my case, I laid down too many tracks. I got so swept up in constructing the possible paths this essay could take that when I geared up to leave the station––to write it all out––I was paralyzed by the tangle before me. Although a lifelong creative, my undergraduate background is predominantly in the sciences and so thinking and writing academically within the context of humanities scholarship is new. The infrastructure of a bridge holds sound because it is built not from one side over to the other but from both sides at once. I want to act as a bridge between the arts and sciences and so I have thrown myself from mountains, from geomorphology and erosion rates, over to a new shore (and country) with cities and people and infrastructures to start building from another perspective. Since arrival, I have been all around disoriented and not at all adept. My ideas are sprawling and interconnected like Centerm shipyard. There is so much this city this class and these books have led me to unpack and explore. For now, however, I am taking one final title, turning in one final direction, and following a single train of thought to an end with the idea of infrastructure in mind.

          I returned to that place on new years eve and watched the sun set in silent company with 2 strangers who'd had the same idea. I walked along the back street and sketched the city from behind.

          Having now inhabited Vancouver for two years and taught this assignment nine times, I find Google’s basemap incongruous with my mental map of the city drawn from practical experience. Navigational maps, writes Laura Kurgan, “impos[e] a quiet tyranny of orientation that erases the possibility of disoriented discovery. . .” (2009, 16-17).

      Spatial awareness of my surroundings has evolved not by following Google's map from A to B or memorizing the trace of its aerial contours, but rather through becoming lost and wandering around. Thus disoriented, I find areas of familiarity connected in surprising ways. . .

          I take the 33 bus to campus on a whim. I'm running late to teach and I don't want to deal with the hassle of Broadway construction. <i>Why have I never taken the 33?</i> I wonder as a 5 minute walk brings me to a deserted stop. I sit on a bench in the sun to catch my breath. The 33 is one of the smaller buses. Its seats have that soft fabric patterned like a roller rink carpet. Riding the 33 is outside my routine. Its route takes me through places I've been before but have never connected by this route. I write these thoughts in the white space of a book I brought with me - <i>A History of My Brief Body</i> by Billy-Ray Belcourt.

        Some time later I boarded the 99 B-Line with Critical Concepts for the Creative Humanities. I was in a rush to leave and grabbed it spontaneously from the pile of books on my kitchen table because it fit in my coat pocket and also because each concept is a 4 page read - the time it takes to ride the 99 Bus 2 stops west along Broadway. It opens in my lap to where I'd hastily tucked an IKEA crayon. A concept I'd been thinking about all day but had yet to visit in this book: Navigations.

          ...navigation entails the production of a performative cartography of a terrain, field, or domain that is constituted in the very act of its exploration. (Tuin and Verhoeff 2022, 137-139).

          Exploration, put one way, is <a href="https://bit.ly/3XeFxZw">"the action of traveling in or through an unfamiliar area in order to learn about it."</a> Though the field (city, body of academic literature) is at first unknown and therefore unfamiliar,   <a href="edies/iteration.html">iterative </a> navigation coheres a web of spatial relations that serves as reference. This is how I conceive of a mental map. Unlike google’s two dimensional map that directs me from A to B, mental maps develop through disorientation and are comprised of "those invisible lines of people, places, and networks that create the most common spaces we live in today" (Kurgan 2013, 17).

      "THE CITY"

      <a name="the-city" id="the-city"></a>
      Through disorientation I realized the city is not a fixed and bounded site which pre-exists my encounter as geographer-researcher and which I may separate myself from in order to map from a distanced, exterior position. Rather, “the city” is performatively constituted as a physical-conceptual field of encounter whose emergent topology is drawn through everyday navigations. As such, the city and I - field and researcher - are entangled, continuously figured and reconfiguring in dynamic relation.

        Nothing is where I left it. I get up for a walk or eat or rest and when I return the words are there but I've forgotten what they meant. Is my thesis just writing about writing a thesis? Or doing fieldwork? I know I thought it all meant something yesterday. I felt it, at least. I had six ideas before noon and but then I read the last chapter of this book and now I'm not so sure what matters. Is it all very simple and elegantly connected from the start? Or is it a tangled snarl of threads which no amount of good writing can unravel. Topology shifts with something so simple as a bikeride along an unfamiliar route. The city and my framework rearranges ever so slightly, coheres, connects back to something last visited a year ago. My working memory can hold no more than four things at a time which makes writing a thesis where everything is connected and also layered and happening all at once very challenging. I don't think one sentence at a time. I feel ideas and their connections, wake up with words in my mouth, and then iterate through phrasings until I land on an arrangement of words and punctuation that best approximates the feeling. And then I write around this grain until a pearl of something is said. I'm trying to practice writing around nothing (yet) - not waiting for the grains to start writing but just saying whatever's on my mind when I feel stuck and seeing if it goes anywhere. It's all the field - all part of the process of it.
