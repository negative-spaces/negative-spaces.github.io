ON ORGANIZATION of
    CONTENT
        Structural organization: sections will be grouped under DEEP MAPPING as CONSTRUCTIVE INTERFERENCE a) with the basemap b) with established forms of knowledge production c) with accepted ways of rendering research public 
            { d) maybe something about rhythms, time, and iteration through theory and practice, though this can be covered in b) }
    FORM
        Multiple navigations will be offered which guide the interlocutor through differing pathways amongst sections contained within the above groupings.

                "His eleveation transfigures him into a voyeur... It puts him at a distance. It ransforms the bewitching world by which one was "posessed" into a text that lies before one's eyes. It allows one to read it, to be a solar Eye, looking down like a god. The exaltation of a scopic and gnostic drive: the fiction of knowledge is related to this lust to be a viewpoint and nothing more." (92)

                ..."Escaping the imaginary totalizations produced by the eye, the everyday has a certain strangeness that does not surface, or whose surface is only the upper limit, outlining itself against the visible." (93)

                >In the chapter Certeau outlines practices outside/counter to geometrical, panoptic, visual geographies and theoretical constructions... Beyond the surfice of the 2D aerial view of the city. 

                >Map --> tool of spatial/urban rhetoric

    Practical Knowledge
        Chapter 9 in Seeing Like a State by James Scott
            "By themselves, the simplified rules can never generate a functioning community, city, or economy. Formal order, to be more explicit, is always and to some considerable degree parasitic on informal processes, which the formal scheme does not recognize, without which it could not exist, and which it alone cannot create or maintain." (310)
            >sequence vs. timing<

            Each of these skills requires hand-eye coordination that comes with practice and a capacity to "read" the waves, the wind, or the road and to make the appropriate adjustments. One powerful indication that they all require metis is that they are exceptionally difficult to teach apart from engaging in the activity itself. One might imagine trying to write down explicit instructions on how to ride a bicycle, but one can scarcely imagine that such instructions would enable a novice to ride a bicycle on the first try. The maxim "Practice makes perfect" was devised for such activities as this, inasmuch as the continual, nearly imperceptible adjustments necessary for riding a bicycle are best learned by having to make them." (313)

    SLOW SCHOLARSHIP/Process oriented
        Deep mapping is an exercise in slow scholarship: it takes time to know a place, to follow curiosity, to become lost. Light waves which penetrate the surface of a bubble take longer to re-emerge than those which reflect (off) the surface.
