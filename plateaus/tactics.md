# Tactics of practice

## tactics vs. strategy
GIS, jon goss --> why deep mapping employs tactics 

>"a tactic is a calculated action determined by the absence of a proper locus. **No delimitation of an exteriority, then, provides it with the condition neces­sary for autonomy.** The space of a tactic is the space of the other. Thus it must play on and with a terrain imposed on it and organized by the law of a foreign power. It does not have the means to keep to itself, at a distance, in a position of withdrawal, foresight, and self-collection: it is a maneuver "within the enemy's field of vision," as von Bülow put it,14 and within enemy territory. It does not, therefore, have the options of plan­ning general strategy and viewing the adversary as a whole within a district, visible, and objectifiable space. It operates in isolated actions, blow by blow. It takes advantage of "opportunities" and depends on them, being without any base where it could stockpile its winnings, build up its own position, and plan raids. What it wins it cannot keep. This nowhere gives a tactic mobility, to be sure, but a mobility that must accept the chance offerings of the moment, and seize on the wing the possibilities that offer themselves at any given moment. It must vigilantly make use of the cracks that particular conjunctions open in the surveil­ lance of the proprietary powers. It poaches in them. It creates surprises in them. It can be where it is least expected. It is a guileful ruse.
**...a tactic boldly juxtaposes diverse elements in order suddenly to produce a flash shedding a different light on the language of a place and to strike the hearer. Cross-cuts, fragments, cracks and lucky hits in the framework of a system,** consumers' ways of operating are the practical equivalents of wit." (de Certeau 1984, 36-39)

## Computational Thinking (GIS) - Recognizing patterns, connecting dots
"The strength of these **computations** [tactics of making do] lies in their **ability to divide**, but this analytical ability eliminates the possibility of representing the tactical trajectories which, according to their own criteria, **select fragments taken from the vast ensembles** of production in order to **compose new stories with them.**" (1984, de Certeau 35)

## Bricolage, Making Do, Gleaning
Les Roberts, in *Spatial Bricolage: The Art of Poetically Making Do* (2018):
>"Whatever is found in whatever landscape the gleaner-bricoleur happens to find herself at whatever time she happens to be there is potentially constituent matter of an assemblage-in-progress, the production of which may take a number of different forms (or none at all - the practice of gleaning-bricolage need not cede an 'output' for it to still count as gleaning and/or bricolage)." 

**"gleaning as spatial praxis"** (Roberts 2018): gleaning in alleys 

[Matthew Arthur “Four Alleys”](https://culanth.org/fieldsights/series/four-alleys)
>“I survey the **patternings** of alley scenes to offer a speculative vocabulary for practicing the data of city life otherwise—each term an incitement to mess with instructions, to make space for the world to keep on.”
“Walking alleys is not about transition, as if place could be stabilized by any easy mapping of movement from A to B. Nor is it meant to transgress method as usual. Rather, walking is “transcorporeal, transitive, and transspecies” (Springgay & Truman 2017)—it activates the ethics of being undifferentiably entangled in world. To walk as method is to contest processes of datafication while dramatizing what is noticed in order to tell stories that matter (Powell 2017).”
“**Alleys are a form of attention,** where abandoned and jerry-rigged uses cue **rhythms of material life that seem too much or not enough.** They are out of sync with market logics, circulatory zones where thriftiness counts as care”
“Property lines are breached with trash.” “The data of my alley walks refuse easy coding"

### Practical knowledge
James Scot on “Thin Simplifications and Practical Knowledge: Mētis.” In Seeing Like a State (1998):
>"By themselves, the simplified rules can never generate a functioning community, city, or economy. Formal order, to be more explicit, is always and to some considerable degree parasitic on informal processes, which the formal scheme does not recognize, without which it could not exist, and which it alone cannot create or maintain." (310)
>"Each of these skills requires hand-eye coordination that comes with practice and a capacity to "read" the waves, the wind, or the road and to make the appropriate adjustments. One powerful indication that they all require metis is that they are exceptionally difficult to teach apart from engaging in the activity itself. One might imagine trying to write down explicit instructions on how to ride a bicycle, but one can scarcely imagine that such instructions would enable a novice to ride a bicycle on the first try. The maxim "Practice makes perfect" was devised for such activities as this, inasmuch as the continual, nearly imperceptible adjustments necessary for riding a bicycle are best learned by having to make them." (313)

unicycling - reading the road

Basically: >sequence vs. timing<
pattern observation
accuracy vs. practicality 
                ("accuracy" of maps)
concept of **mētis**: "adapt to a constantly shifting situation" and "understand, and hence outwit... adversaries" (313) (Odysseus in deceiving the cyclops)
activities that especially engage metis require (313): 
- practice in hand-eye coordination (me: juggling)
- capacity to process incoming information ("read" waves, wind, road) and make appropriate adjustments
- such activities are "exceptionally difficult to teach apart from engaging in the activity itself" --> deep mapping; learning as/thru doing (CCCH)
- "The necessarily implicit, experiential nature of metis seems central."(315)
- "The practice and experience reflected in metis is almost always local." (317)
-  "any formula that excludes or suppresses the experience, knowledge, and adaptability of metis risks incoherence and failure; learning to speak coherent sentences involves far more than merely learning the rules of grammar" (319)
- developed through iteration!
- "The practice and experience reflected in metis is almost always local." (317)
gap b/w general knowledge and situated knowledge - whats lost in jumping scales- like tracing a screenshot of aerial google maps vancouver to get a sense of the city vs inhabiting it for a while

## Theory as a toolkit
"the researcher-as-bricoleur goes about his or her business equipped with a set of tools rather than a fit-for-purpose methodological strategy" (Roberts 2018, 54)

>Foucault: "... In this sense **theory does not express, translate, or serve to apply practice: it is practice.** But it is local and regional, as you said, and not totalising. **This is a struggle against power, a struggle aimed at revealing and undermining power where it is most invisible and insidious.** It is not to "awaken consciousness" that we struggle (the masses have been aware for some time that consciousness is a form of knowledge; and consciousness as the basis of subjectivity is a prerogative of the bourgeoisie), but to sap power, to take power; it is an activity conducted alongside those who struggle for power, and not their illumination from a safe distance. **A "theory " is the regional system of this struggle.**"
Deleuze "Precisely. **A theory is exactly like a box of tools. It has nothing to do with the signifier. It must be useful. It must function. And not for itself. If no one uses it, beginning with the theoretician himself (who then ceases to be a theoretician), then the theory is worthless or the moment is inappropriate....** A theory does not totalise; it is an instrument for multiplication and it also multiplies itself." (Foucault 1977, Conversation on Intellectuals and Power)

Proper deployment of theory - a tactic
methods - a tactic
deep mapping must be practiced. It does not exist as a theory. only praxis. 
my thesis here not only conveys a theory of a practice generated through the practice but enacts the practice... see rendering portion 
     
### My toolskit
Analogue, methods, material practices of engaging texts
where i explain/demonstrate eclectic methods; skills, tools, and materials i employ (as appropriate) in my research-creation process
why analogue at times - when do i employ the digital and for what ends? all part of apparatus


tactics are transgressive, deep mapping is transgressive knowledge production
