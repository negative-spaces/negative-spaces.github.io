        I take the 33 bus to campus on a whim. I'm running late to teach and I don't want to deal with the hassle of Broadway construction. Why have I never taken the 33 I wonder as a 5 minute walk brings me to an empty stop. I sit on a bench in the sun to catch my breath a moment before the bus pulls up. Its one of the smaller busses and the seats have the soft fabric patterned like a roller rink carpet. Riding the 33 is outside my routine. It's route takes me through places I've been before but have yet to connect via this navigation. ("I didn't realize the WISE was so close to Commercial! I came a different way last time. Oh, I remember walking through this park though! Okay, now I know where I am and where the WISE 'really is' on the map.") The city is daily reinvented in my imagination. (Constant shifting of field --> 'immersive cartography' concept by Roussell.)It emerges for me not through place making alone but from connections - spatial relationships - drawn by my moving in/out/through/between/among areas of familiarity/encounter.

        Navigations articulate a mental map of place. And, though forever evolving and contingent, as the the field becomes more densely networked with/through unique connections the more anchored in relation to one another specific areas or spots become. In this way, navigation makes navigable. For me, spatial awareness of the place I inhabit - that geographical field of my encounter - develops through embodied spatial practices (see tactics) including everyday navigations.  

    I wrote these thoughts initially in the whitespace of _A brief history of my body_ by Billy-Ray Belcourt. Around the margin, in the negative space of another story. Each time I leave home I carefully select which books to bring with me, not because I will necessarily read them, but more because I like their company. I bring along the people/stories/concepts I wish to think with for the day. Often I bring more than one book. I like to put texts into conversation first amongst themselves. In my bag they interlap, folding together they bookmark one another. Opening one, I open myself: read me. 

    More recently I boarded the 99 bus with Critical Concepts for the Creative Humanities. I brought this book because each concept is but a few pages - the distance between City Hall and MacDonald if you ride the 99 along Broadway. It opens to where I'd hastily tucked a crayon, to a page I'd never before been: Navigations. 

        "...navigation entails the production of a performative cartography of a terrain, field, or domain that is constituted in the very act of its exploration" (Tuin and Verhoeff 2022, 137-139).

    Just as navigating the geographical field articulates a mental map of physical space navigations within a conceptual field articulate a theoretical framework - a cognitive conceptualization of an emergent web of connection at which my ideas tug and pull. Following a concept in multiple directions I find myself making surprising connections. I write "follow" because when I loosen my desire to arrive at a specific place, when I release control of the destination as it were, I make room for latent connections to make themselves (apparent). ("Research-creation follows desire, and builds spaces and contexts that allow the time and space to _experiment in unpredictable directions_." -Loveless)
    
    "constituted" "act" "exploration"
    Exploration, put one way, is "the action of traveling in or through an unfamiliar area in order to learn about it." (https://bit.ly/3XeFxZw) Deep mapping is a practice of learning through disorientation. Embracing the unknown unknown opens the explorer/deep mapper to possibilities unlimited by expectation. (To disoriented discovery.) Though the field, geographical or conceptual, is at first unknown, unfamiliar, and disorienting (where am I? I am at a loss for relational context, without map) the iterative act of navigating, of finding ways around, over time, coheres a framework (network, web) of reference (points) within a field (plane) itself constituted through its exploration. 
    
        "...navigation itself produces knowledge that feeds into its course and experience itself." (Tuin and Verhoeff 2022, 137-139) 

    Deep mapping is practice-based research because I generate knowledge by means of a creative practice (Candy). I don't simply "think place," I act(ualize) it. Everyday navigations like riding the bus or walking the bridge are journeys of thought. I think *with* the field of my encounter as it unfolds for me. Iterating through theory and practice is the rhythm of deep mapping as research-creation. What does any of this mean? 
    
    To explain what I experience as "...iterative loops between action, experience, and knowledge" (Tuin and Verhoeff, 2022), I introduce a form which I grew up drawing and walking as part of Waldorf early education pedagogy: The Lemniscate.

Detour 

        Later in the day I'm sitting outside with the same book, writing these musings from the _margins_ to html. A stranger approaches me and asks me, says I'm the only person he's seen today using a physical book. We get to talking. He's in his eighties, never travelled, says he talks instead to all sorts of people to build an understanding of the wider
        world. He offers me advice: something about detours being an important part of the journey. 
        
        Taking the 33 instead of the 99 B-Line to campus was a detour from my habitual route. I'd never taken the 33 before but it goes to show spontaneity (in my practical experience) is often met with serendipitous convergences. 

    //My commute is fieldwork. Process oriented research recognizes the journey as a site of learning (and knowledge production!).

    Detour Maps
         Construction at the intersection disorient familiar navigations. Re-orientation can only be established from looking around; from the city's map -- only further disorientation. 
   
Lost (v.) Losing
    I lost my initial project outline when my computer broke unexpectedly. For two months (October - November) I worked analogue and between a friend's computer and the public library. Finally buying a new device I learned I'd have to wait till January to recover scrivener files backed up (once, on a whim, call that spontaneous serendipity) to the cloud. Losing my outline and writings from the fall was disorienting. However, it allowed for the re-formation of my thoughts and the push to figure out a different way to organize my writing. Without this detour I wouldn't have thought to use a code editor to write, git to save and track changes, and GitHub to organize my text in process. 

    Getting lost as a practice--> solo
    (Bike ride on the north shore - feeling where the path was!)
    Slow scholarship (tkaes time sentence)


    Like many colleagues, beginning a graduate program meant moving to a new city, biome, country. I arrived in Vancouver disoriented. I graded sixty maps of downtown before I finally ventured there. Points, Lines, Polygon planes - memorizing contours blurb [insert paragraph from lecture I gave but the contents of which I lost to the cloud pending account recovery on january 9th.] While Google Maps helped me get from A to B, the drive to locate and coordinate precludes disoriented discovery.     

        "It seems as though in the end, maps —the successful ones, the ones that show us where we are and get us from here to there —risk offering only two alternatives. They let us see too much, and hence blind us to what we cannot see, imposing a quiet tyranny of orientation that erases the possibility of disoriented discovery, or they lose sight of all the other things that we ought to see. They omit, according to their conventions, those invisible lines of people, places, and networks that create the most common spaces we live in today." (Laura Kurgan, 16-17 from Close up and at a distance)


 ^^^  There are multiple ways to connect concepts, multiple pathways to understanding, multiple routes to a destination. 
   
Embracing the unknown unknown opens the explorer to possibilities unlimited by expectation. To disoriented discovery.
