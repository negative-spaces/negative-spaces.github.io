        My theory of deep mapping is constituted through my practice of deep mapping.
        <br><br>
        That sentence took nine months of writing and re-writing. Indeed, I wrote that sentence while my theorization was still taking shape. What I'd finally found were words to state how my theory, the knowledge co-produced, the link between theory and practice and the what of my entire project - all emerge from my iteration through theory and practice. Situated. Embodied. With/In place.

        Navigation makes navigable the field. To further describe the "iterative loops between action, experience, and knowledge" (Tuin and Verhoeff 2022, 138) which form my research (and whose form my research takes), I introduce the lemniscate: âˆž The lemniscate is a form I grew up drawing and walking as part of Waldorf pedagogy. Beginning in first grade 1, along with 20 classmates, learned form drawing and Eurythmy. Eurythmy is "visible speech, visible music" / "music translated into movement" (Steiner 1923) - a spatial practice accompanied by piano whose every class began by walking a lemniscate for nearly ten minutes. Facing forward we flowed as one body in continuous motion. Although eurythmy was, without exception, our least favorite block, I have no doubt practicing it twice a week for eight years significantly developed my sense of spatial awareness. Also beginning in grade one was the practice of form drawing. Sitting in silence for an hour or more we would draw a form like the lemniscate over and over, the crayon in constant contact with the page. Form drawing is process oriented: "It is the _act_ of drawing that educates, not the result" (Gebert 1987, 8). **The embodied iteration of patterns was a fundamental mechanism by which representational subjects like writing and arithmetic were later taught.** My critiques of Waldorf pedagogy notwithstanding, I attribute my acute spatial awareness and orientation towards sensorium to my experience of "multisensory learning, where ears and eyes and voice, hands and feet, mind and memory, all work together to reinforce each other" (Gebert 1987, 12). The iteration of a form reveals beginning and end to be merely places of turning and return. Practice is a commitment to transformation.
