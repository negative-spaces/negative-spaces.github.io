        <div id="scroll-text">My first view of Vancouver. The morning after I arrived, August 7th, I walked from 30th
            all the way down to the shore. I knew nothing of this place before coming here. I'd googled pictures of the
            city once back when I was deciding which offer to
            accept<!--I could do a computational focused MSc. in San Diego, an professional program for cartography in the Twin Cities, a Geographic Information Science PhD in Texas, and a master's of applied geography in New Mexico.-->Each
            path led, in my mind, to a divergent trajectory. Who was I going to become? The pandemic began during the
            spring of my sophomore year of undergrad. Within 2 weeks my life radically altered and I decided to graduate
            the next year and go somewhere new. I spent a year isolated in rural Maine. It was there that I began
            walking in the woods, practicing something I called <a
                href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/4ab243f6d7b3490bbfa884d18a788236">isolation
                psychogeography</a>. Under the mentorship of my Intro to GIS teacher, the best teacher I've ever known,
            I explored critical and creative cartographies for my honors thesis. My undergraduate studies were in
            physical geography and geographic information science. I chose geography because, as seems to be common
            among geography undergrads in the states, I had an exceptional AP Human Geography teacher in UBC was the
            only MA program I applied to and though my final decision was on impulse, I think I felt the lure of
            openness to define my own project according to a mix of interests. And mentorship by someone who's skills
            and knowledge spanned a breadth of fields. Looking back on my research statement submitted this time two
            years ago (January 2021), my general aim remains the same:
            <br><br>
            <span class="quote" style="margin-left: 15%; margin-right:8%">
                I am a renaissance student whose skills in the arts and sciences unite in Geographic Information
                Science. My research interests lie in GeoVisualization, Critical Cartography, and the Geohumanities. I
                value both qualitative and quantitative methodologies, and am especially drawn to the ways both
                practices supplement each other. The research streams Digital Geographies, Geospatial Analysis, GIS and
                Knowledge, Ideas, Practices are both of interest to me for I seek the technical skills to map
                transdisciplinary patterns, not just conceptualize them. While my undergraduate background is in the
                physical sciences, I am fundamentally a creative whose passion lies with critical examinations of
                people, their interaction with each other, and response to the natural and built environment.</span>
            <br>
            i've inhabited this place for a year and a half now. i drove to vancouver from the other side of the
            continent via somewhere in the middle of the united states. for the first time in my life i left a familiar
            place without a plan. i had no map save a Rand McNally Atlas of U.S. Road Atlas which i am embarrassed to
            say i forsook in favor of googles maps. even then, however, my journey unfolded in ways i never could have
            imagined and so slowly, i became comfortable with being uncomfortable. with not knowing what lies ahead. so
            much can happen between departure and destination. yet when the goal of a journey is the destination alone,
            getting lost is experienced as an inconvenience. therefore, maps are used to plot a path from A to B,
            departure to destination. with digital maps such as google maps, GPS will geolocate you in cartesian space
            so long as you remain in range of satellite reception. follow the directions spoken in synthesized sentences
            and you won't ever have to feel disoriented. you can't get lost. [recalculating...] you can't get lost
            <br>

            <span style="margin-left: 20%;">and reorient your attention to the space between departure and
                destination.</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            my journey to vancouver, into graduate school, and through this project until now has been a process of
            disoriented discovery. everything between departure and destination shapes where you end up. because deep
            mapping is process oriented research, so much of what went into articulating the negative spaces assembled
            above risks being relegated itself to negative space.to intentionally disorient oneself, to get lost as
            method, to slow down, to be guided by serendipity, to follow non-linear trajectories, to start something and
            start over. and over. and over and then claim that all this not only informs that which has coalesced as
            creative output but actually constitutes the research product is my commitment.

            <p>I lived in Dunbar for 7 months after I moved to vancouver. Dunbar is a neighborhood farthest west,
                separated from campus only by Pacific Spirit Park. To commute into the department my housemate and I
                would bike a few blocks to the park then through the woods until we came out at campus luxury
                residences. We'd ride the road, rounding two rotaries, then up one last slope to the main mall. Waving
                goodbye we'd coast the final way to our respective buildings. Where you live in the city matters for how
                you view it. It was a wealthy area of single families and dream homes with no architectural consistency.
                I lived in a tiny house from the 1920s with blackberries in the front and garden beds in the back. Five
                other people lived there, one which made it hell. Dunbar was far from downtown but close to the quieter
                beaches so I began going there after classes instead of home.

    <div id="scroll-box">
        <div id="scroll-text">
                Two months after I arrived in vancouver I began classes and TAing the undergraduate cartography course.
                My role as TA involved facilitating 3 lab sessions a week during which I'd introduce the assignment,
                demonstrate the use of Adobe Illustrator and ArcGIS, and troubleshoot questions. I also marked all 60
                students' weekly lab submissions, the majority of which were maps. The first lab assignment was to make
                a map of downtown Vancouver by tracing a screenshot from google maps. The rubric required land and water
                be differentiated by contour and color, a few 'well known' streets, and 5 points of interest which were
                given. The resulting map no practical use beyond an image. A tourist could not use it for navigation
                without referring to google maps. Which made me wonder whether these maps of the city reflected
                students' lived experience? And if not, what did they render? Or, rather, render invisible?

                I, like many colleagues and undergraduate students, had just moved here. Overwhelm dealing with
                household drama and academic demoralization it took me 6 months before I ventured downtown. I marked 60
                maps of a place I'd never been. They were arrangements of points, lines, and polygons for which I had no
                contextual mental map. By my third term TAing the class I'd walked nearly every street downtown. Before
                the first lab I invited students to spend 5 minutes sketching their mental map of vancouver. Nearly all
                were attempts at reproducing a memorized aerial contour. Areas of inhabitation or commute were more
                articulated/detailed. I think this is important somehow - the practice of connecting (with) your mental
                map before abstracting a place you know from on-the-ground navigation. It helps reveal what flat maps
                relegate to negative space. The required points of attraction I still haven't been to - and probably
                never will. They aren't what interest me.

    <div id="scroll-box">
        <div id="scroll-text">
                My first excursion downtown I took the 7 from Dunbar all the way to the waterfront. I was stuck on a
                term paper and figured disorientation might help. It did. I got off the bus somewhere by the shipyard
                and found a bridge (an infra/structure which has supported me since then). The following became the
                Prologue to that term paper:<br><br>
                <span style="float: left; margin-left:10%">
                    Where Main Street ends, at the boundary between Gastown and the Downtown Eastside, there is a
                    bridge. Well it’s more of a ramp really that curls around so the road never ends but continues by a
                    different name in a new direction. I found myself there the other morning, standing alone just
                    gazing towards the North Shore Mountains. It was clear and cold and snow had settled over their
                    jagged peaks in a perfect gradient. Before the mountains and directly below me spread a panoply of
                    infrastructure––Vancouver’s Centennial Terminals. Tower cranes, gantry cranes, straddle carriers,
                    forklifts, trucks, trains, train tracks, shipping containers, and pipes of iron and steel. Every
                    dimension was in motion. Machinery moved slowly and methodically while humans moved in erratic
                    zig-zags around the pavement. Some were operating the machinery while some machinery were operating
                    themselves. As a train drew in below me I peered down to see the conductor watching the switchboard,
                    prepared to take action in the event of system failure. But what happens when the train is your
                    argument and it fails to budge along the tracks you’ve set out for it to follow? In my case, I laid
                    down too many tracks. I got so swept up in constructing the possible paths this essay could take
                    that when I geared up to leave the station––to write it all out––I was paralyzed by the tangle
                    before me. Although a lifelong creative, my undergraduate background is predominantly in the
                    sciences and so thinking and writing academically within the context of humanities scholarship is
                    new. The infrastructure of a bridge holds sound because it is built not from one side over to the
                    other but from both sides at once. I want to act as a bridge between the arts and sciences and so I
                    have thrown myself from mountains, from geomorphology and erosion rates, over to a new shore (and
                    country) with cities and people and infrastructures to start building from another perspective.
                    Since arrival, I have been all around disoriented and not at all adept. My ideas are sprawling and
                    interconnected like Centerm shipyard. There is so much this city this class and these books have led
                    me to unpack and explore. For now, however, I am taking one final title, turning in one final
                    direction, and following a single train of thought to an end with the idea of infrastructure in
                    mind.

                Early April 2022, my friend and I are walking along a familiar street and see, resting amongst the
                regular fairy
                pebbles and kitsch that decorate the bases of so many chestnut trees in this neighborhood, a
                box of chalk.
                It’s an open-ended invitation to which we respond by pausing to draw colorful forms on the
                sidewalk. “Very
                affirming” comments a passerby as they smile and skirt around us. In this moment, we have
                transformed an
                otherwise pedestrian space into a place of interest, using what mediums surround us to
                engage with the city
                and its passersby.
                <br><br>
                days later we walked the same sidewalk and saw the weathered impression dissolving back to
                abstraction. i
                wonder how many soles picked up pieces of chalk and how far our art walked with them.<br>

                The city is hazy and so am I. I wake up late, spend till noon fighting the residual stupor of sleeping
                pills. Insomnia comes in waves; I pray it ebbs. I do five things at once without thinking: I wash the
                dishes while
                putting away glasses. I drop them all, I sweep them up and the faucet is still running. I try to eat. I
                choke. I'm unable to swallow like my body is rejecting input. I'm out of breath. My senses dulled. I'm

                I begin writing for my thesis in a place I come to often - usually late in the morning with
                a smoke and a
                couple hours uninterrupted thinking behind me. From where I stand now I see at once the
                hazy outline of mountains above downtown's quiet skyscrapers, the subway construction at
                Broadway & Cambie
                that exposes the guts of the city while slowing traffic and reconfiguring pedestrian flows,
                and, directly below
                me, people walking rolling and riding about their day.<br><br>

                I like places that offer me perspective, like this spot, or the rooftop parkade of the
                supermarket two blocks
                from here or Granville Bridge. Places above the ground offer an alternate framing of what
                goes on <i>in</i> the city
                - the field in which I practice deep mapping. The sensorium is less overwhelming up here.
                Less abrasive. Bodily
                distanced, I feel less. Vertically distanced, I see more. The places I have Been fall into
                some geospatial
                context. (The surest method of developing spatial awareness, however, is getting lost on the
                ground.) From such
                a vantage, the city and my thesis are more
                easily theorized. I'll take out my notebook or my voice recorder and let the ideas flow.
                <i>Later I'll write
                    these up and push them to FIELD_NOTES. I say.</i> Today is the first time I write in
                this place in this place. (Well, I just moved a few feet to a
                stone bench to let a skater boy eat his dinner sitting perched on the very edge. I have
                stood there for 2 hours
                after all. He's playing Bad Bunny which isn't this entry's mood so I'll wrap up this entry
                for today.) Tl;dr:
                Ive written here so many times but with nothing to show (you). Today I write directly on my
                laptop as
                the sun sets against a thousand windows and the chill of a second fall has me wondering
                where all the time
