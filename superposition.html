          <p style="text-align: center;"><b>SUPERPOSITION</b>how praxis comes to matter<br><br>
        <b>diffractive mapping of 2 presentations of research</b>
        <br><br>After my symposium presentation I was asked: "Are you more of a wave or a particle?" All I could think to say then was "interesting how you've framed the question as an either or..." <br><br>I've been holding the question in mind since - subconsciously mostly - until a thought came one morning like the momentary illumination of lighting:<br><br>
        I am (we are all) both wave and particle. Although routinely apprehended as individuals, fixed, bounded, defined bodies, we are permeable - continuously transfiguring through encounters, experiencing life as a process transforming and transfiguring through intra-action. We emanate waves (affect) which interfere and are interfered with by others, human and nonhuman. To practice deep mapping is to embody superposition. Paradox is not a closure but an opening - to possibilities - the existence of multiple states, simultaneous multiplicities, inextricable layers.  
        <br><br>
        <b>its all the field</b>
        praxis is diffractice -- thinking through practice, enacting interference, mapping differences, generating new patterns. WHEN ITS ALL THE FIELD EVERYWHERE BECOMES A SITE FOR PRAXIS 
        ***Deep mapping :: research-creation ::  interference :: diffraction :: transformation through encounter, two waves (rhythms) are spatiotemporally aligned and in so being alter and are altered by one another producing a new wave (subject/object, researcher/field, Lily/City)***
        
        Praxis is both a site and tactic of interference (site: superposition, duh, layering, rendering of diffraction or thinking through practice) (tactic: interfering from within system with circles boundsary of legibility, valorizing otherwise intelligible forms) 

        also github - litearlly renders marks of similarities and differences --> merge--> overlays 

        READING between the lines -- negative space -- then diffractive analysis - literally reading between both sets of lines. simialrities and differences. light and dark. both the field.
