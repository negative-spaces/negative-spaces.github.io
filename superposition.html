    Through the course of my master's <a href="./rendering.html#research-creation" target="_blank">research-creation</a>, I have explored and responded to the question: What could it mean to think <i>with</i> place? To <i>feel</i> the city? I have done so through deep mapping — what I interpret to be situated, embodied inhabitation as a practice of ongoing and open-ended dialogue within and as part of the world. Deep mapping resists preemptive definition for it is <i>through practicing</i> deep mapping that deep mapping becomes articulated as an apparatus of investigation. Like a <a href="./interference.html#baradian-apparatuses" target="_blank">Baradian 'diffractive apparatus' (Barad 2007)</a>, deep mapping at times it is the object of my investigation and at times, the instrument. Thinking through my practice of deep mapping as well as reading theories through one another and the effects of my practice, I have come to understand deep mapping as a capacious practice marked by iterative acts of interference with hegemonic forms of representing place, producing geographic knowledge, and rendering spatial research public. Deep mapping is an interference practice aimed at articulating the boundaries of hegemonic forms of intelligibility and performatively refiguring them through proposing alternative configurations. Whereas my theory of deep mapping is the diffraction pattern marking the effects of my deep mapping practice, <code>negative-spaces</code> is the diffraction pattern marking the effects of my deep mapping praxis. This page re/iterates important interferences made by <code>negative-spaces</code>, as well gestures towards future directions for research.
  </p>


  <p>
    <span style="font-weight:700;">research output: <code>negative-spaces</code></span><br>
    I have submitted to cIRcle, UBC's institutional repository for graduate research, a file formatted and entitled <code>ubc_2024_november_crandalloral_lilydemet_negative-spaces.zip</code>. This, along with a nine page .pdf document containing metadata and instructions on how to unzip <code>negative-spaces</code>, constitutes my MA thesis in geography. My thesis is the first MA thesis in the the University of British Columbia's history of Electronic Thesis and Dissertation submissions to consist entirely of a website, without a significant research component submitted as text in .pdf form. The webbed site constituted through a visitor's intra-action with <code>negative-spaces</code> marks the effects of my deep mapping praxis. Like graffiti, <code>negative-spaces</code> is inherently multimodal. The text and audio/visual components cannot be separated without altering the meaning their composition conveys. By citing <a href="./tactics.html#hybrid-surface-inscriptions" target="_blank">'hybrid surface inscriptions' (Andron 2016)</a> from the physical-conceptual field of my encounter, <code>negative-spaces</code> participates in unruly flows of material-semiotics. It challenges citational conventions that consecrate the authority of human authors, and, in so doing, I enact interference with hegemonic forms of academic knowledge re/production.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight:700;">Sitation</span><br>
    My intellectual contribution — in practice, in theory, and in research output — is therefore site specific. <code>negative-spaces</code> sites a provisional configuration of ideas whose articulation entails the exclusion of all other/d possible configurations. Part of my research practice therefore included cultivating a responsiveness to the ways in which my research-creation draws boundaries, figuring intelligibility as the effect of such exclusions. I realized citation to be one such significant boundary drawing practice, for it is through the practices by which we acknowledge interlocutors in knowledge production that intellecting others are constituted as such. If agential realism figures posthuman publics (see <code><a href="./interference.html#thinking-with" target="_blank">negative-spaces/interference.html#thinking-with</a></code>), new ways of referencing/acknowledging thinking <i>with</i> intellecting others and the practice through which they are constituted are required. In <code><a href="./tactics.html" target="_blank">negative-spaces/tactics.html</a></code> and <code><a href="./rendering.html" target="_blank">negative-spaces/rendering.html</a></code>, I proposed <i>sitation</i> as an alternative boundary drawing practice to citation, one which recognizes encounters as phenomena wherein field<i>site</i> and researcher (equipped with tactics of investigation) intra-actively mark one another. Sitation assumes agencies and object of investigation to be provisional configurations where encounter's formal acknowledgement within an academic work renders <i>intra-locutors</i> differentially determinate. Whereas citation cites int<i>er</i>action, sitation sites int<i>ra</i>-action. Sitation is a tactic for refiguring the form of in-text citation to accommodate situated, embodied research practices. Sitation expands who and what gets to count/comes to matter as intellecting others in the creation of a formal research output. Sitations are diffraction patterns marking the effects of intra-actions. In other words, <i>sitations site interferences</i>.
  </p>

  <p>
    egative space gives definition to the intelligible form by being that which the intelligible form is not. The boundary, or difference, between intelligible and <i>un</i>intelligible is articulated when that which the intelligible form excludes shows up within the space of the intelligible. Negative space and intelligibility are in relation not of opposition but of complementary constitution––an entanglement I believe to be analogous to (if not the same as) Michel Foucault's rendering of limit and transgression. Locating my thesis in <code>negative-spaces</code> brings to the fore alternate forms of knowledge production and academic reproduction. And, in doing so, <code>negative-spaces</code> enacts an interference which redraws the definition of possibility. It's not one against another (opposition) but a Baradian 'intra-action' which reveals the limit through the transgressive act of refiguring (the boundaries of) intelligibility. Sitation cites modes of knowledge production rendered illegible by citational conventions that reproduce linear text .pdfs as the primarily intelligible research outputs. Sitation 'neuroqueers' (Walker 2021) citation by interfering with neuronormative formats of acknowledgement, as well as the forms "intellectual engagement" and "interlocutors" may take. <code>negative-spaces</code> sites negative spaces from within hegemonic frameworks of intelligibility.

    <p>
    <i>Many stories exist in the landscape</i>, says a wooden frame erected at Jericho Beach Park, <i>What do you see?</i> Do different stories render different cities? Or is it, as so exquisitely suggested by Italo Calvino's <i>Invisible Cities</i> (1974), that different framings focus a city differently, evoking a multiplicity of stories, each one rendering some aspects of a landscape intelligible to the exclusion of others? 
    </p>

    <p>
      I am a bricoleur-as-researcher, conducting transdisciplinary investigations into everyday urban geographies through both affective and technoscientific research practices. I craft multimodal artifacts which perform bricolage with the physical-conceptual fields of my encounter. Over the past three years of my research-creation, I have come to understand what is needed to produce 'situated knowledges' (Haraway 1988) of the place one inhabits is not reflexivity on the part of the geographer-cartographer-researcher, or merely an approach which counters the hegemonic one, but an account of <i>how</i> differences come to matter as the effects of boundary making practices. Drawing from what I have learned, I want to suggest "the city" as a phenomenon within which empirical formations (themselves phenomena) like spatial data and maps (be they mental or physical/digital) are intra-actively produced through both technoscientific and affective agencies of observation. 'Top down' and 'bottom up' mapping practices simply perform different agential cuts, the effects of which do not oppose one another but overlap in the everyday, their interference constituting the entangled viscera of urban bodies as they are rendered differentially intelligible. To study phenomena, their entangled states, and/or the apparatuses performing agential cuts from an exterior position, however, requires building a larger diffractive apparatus (Barad 2007, 345). This is what I intend to do in my PhD. I want to build a diffractive apparatus to study how the phenomenal city comes to differentially matter through the entangled effects of 'top down' and 'bottom up' boundary making practices. Reimagining referent "the city" from a fixed and bounded object to a phenomenon, dynamically figured through the posthuman performativity of 'iterative intra-activity' (Barad 2007), allows for a multiplicity of stories to be superpositioned in one place. The indeterminacy of which story comes to matter is resolved by boundary making practices which differentially frame the landscape. Accounting for boundary making practices is important in order to remain responsive to how some stories become privileged while others are "excluded from mattering" (Barad 2007, 220).

      Although routinely apprehended as individuals with definite bodies whose boundaries preexist encounter, our contours are really permeable, provisional, composed and continuously recomposed through iterative intra-actions. To practice deep mapping is to embody superposition. The wave-particle duality of matter reveals entanglements to be the "poetics of paradox and ambiguity essential to open deep mapping" (Modeen and Biggs 2020, 53). Cacophony is a diffraction pattern marking the interference of incommensurable intelligibilities. Entanglement is touching is "a cacophony of always already reiteratively intra-acting stories" (Barad 2012, 206-7).  Paradox is not a closure but an opening — to possibilities — the existence of entangled states, simultaneous multiplicities, inextricable layers.

 <!--15 minute city interlude -->
     <!-- <div>
    <p>
      Much of my fieldwork has involved navigating Vancouver, my empirics emerging as inextricable layerings of sensorium, affect, and infrastructure. Alongside my thesis I have TAed a departmental cartography course as well as completed cartographic research assistance and freelance cartography. I also work in the university library Research Commons, teaching and consulting on geospatial matters as well as developing and facilitating workshops on mapping and geographic information systems (GIS). 
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the workshops I led for the library was on building walkability indexes with GIS (“Network Analysis,” n.d.). GIS, or geographic information systems, are the computational programs, desktop applications, and infrastructural hardware that facilitate the distribution, visualization, and analysis of geospatial data. Geospatial data are data for which a locational property, such as coordinate or street address, is measured. Much like excel assists in performing mathematical calculations on numerical datasets or Nvivo helps highlight patterns across qualitative records, GIS assist in performing spatial analysis on georeferenced datasets. A walkability index is a quantitative assessment of the relative accessibility of amenities within a delineated area. The workshop assumed as its empirics geospatial datasets which render the city down from above as a collection of points, lines, and polygons. Indeed, it is possible to make the  entire index without any reference to on-the-ground, everyday navigations. Given geospatial data representing Vancouver's city blocks, population density, and amenities, GIS provides the tools to analyze proximity and connection, as well as visualize the result through a map.
    </p>
    <p>
      Around the same time as I was preparing to present the walkability workshop, I began noticing these '15 minute City <span style="font-weight:500">Ready</span>' stickers popping up along the Vancouver Greenway, a stretch of the old Canadian Pacific railroad that's been transposed into a designated pedestrian and bike path. Conceptualized by city planner Carlos Moreno, the '15 minute city' is the idea “that cities should be designed or redesigned so that, within the distance of a 15-minute walk or bike ride, people should be able to live the essence of what constitutes the urban experience: to access work, housing, food, health, education, culture and leisure” (Moreno 2020). Over the course of the spring, more stickers appeared, pasted over DO NOT ENTER EXCEPT BICYCLES signs and those yellow/black striped hazard markers. At the same time that the stickers began proliferating east, west, and even across the bridge into downtown, they also began being scratched off. Reapplication, however, was swift. Then I sighted something different: at first one then two sites, scrawled in blue sharpie over '15 minute City <span style="font-weight:500">Ready</span>' was the declaration RESIST.
      </p>

      <p>
        But resist what? Well it turns out the '15 minute City <span style="font-weight:500">Ready</span>' stickers are actually in protest of the ‘15 minute city’––the decal’s chain-link background representing enforced limited mobility. The location and surface of the stickers' placement is therefore significant. The signification of protest comes to matter through the stickers’ material-semiotic interference with infrastructural boundary demarcations. City signs become palimpsests––sites of super/im/position signaling contested urbanisms. This led me to think about how proximity and connection are measured, the city imagined, and urban space produced through both technoscientific and affective spatial practices.
