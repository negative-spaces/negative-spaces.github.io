            My theory of deep mapping is constituted through my practice of deep mapping.
            <br><br>
            That sentence took nine months of writing and re-writing. Indeed, I wrote that sentence while my theorization was still taking shape. What I'd finally found were words to state how my theory, the knowledge co-produced, the link between theory and practice and the what of my entire project - all emerge from my iteration through theory and practice. Situated. Embodied. With/In place.
            <br><br>
            >"...navigation itself produces knowledge that feeds into its course and experience itself." (Tuin and Verhoeff 2022, 137-139).
            <br><br>
            Navigation makes navigable the field. To further describe the "iterative loops between action, experience, and knowledge" (Tuin and Verhoeff 2022, 138) which form my research (and whose form my research takes), I introduce the lemniscate: ∞ The lemniscate is a form I grew up drawing and walking as part of Waldorf pedagogy. Beginning in first grade 1, along with 20 classmates, learned form drawing and Eurythmy. Eurythmy is "visible speech, visible music" / "music translated into movement" (Steiner 1923) - a spatial practice accompanied by piano whose every class began by walking a lemniscate for nearly ten minutes. Facing forward we flowed as one body in continuous motion. Although eurythmy was, without exception, our least favorite block, I have no doubt practicing it twice a week for eight years significantly developed my sense of spatial awareness. Also beginning in grade one was the practice of form drawing. Sitting in silence for an hour or more we would draw a form like the lemniscate over and over, the crayon in constant contact with the page. Form drawing is process oriented: "It is the _act_ of drawing that educates, not the result" (Gebert 1987, 8). **The embodied iteration of patterns was a fundamental mechanism by which representational subjects like writing and arithmetic were later taught.** My critiques of Waldorf pedagogy notwithstanding, I attribute my acute spatial awareness and orientation towards sensorium to my experience of "multisensory learning, where ears and eyes and voice, hands and feet, mind and memory, all work together to reinforce each other" (Gebert 1987, 12). The iteration of a form reveals beginning and end to be merely places of turning and return. Practice is a commitment to transformation.

        ### Thoughts on rendering - February; updated July 10, 2023
        <br><br>
(cartesian) maps render place by *reducing* the "fleshy," textural, and experiential to a flattened representation. 
<br><br>
to say such maps rend the material from the world in order to render (symbolize) it, however, perpetuates the notion that the symbolic and material are separable.
<br><br>
    how then might spatial praxes be rendered without being flattened, georeferenced, or vectorized? >>in other words, how do I render my practice based geography as a thesis "product" for evaluation (and institutional degree conferral) without submitting a linear PDF and a separate, creative work? 
    <br><br>
    By working with git/GitHub and building an evolving space to contain & visualize my writing as well as mind maps, field notes, audio, visuals etc., I commit (get it) to process oriented research which resists privileging outcome over process. I integrate the two. 
        The web-space will itself be a realm for the disoriented discovery of the gleanings from my practice of deep mapping. As mentioned in ./orientation.txt, From my iteration through theory and practice and by thinking with the (conceptual, geographical, institutional) fields of my encounter, I evolve my own interpretation of deep mapping that serves for now, for this project:    
            Deep mapping is marked by iterative acts of interference with hegemonic forms (norms) of engaging place, producing geographic knowledge, and rendering spatial research public.
    This is how not only in content but *in form* my thesis responds to the charge for praxis to extend beyond study and actually enact knowledge production differently (Narayan and Rosenman 2022). 
    <br><br>
    Yet enacting otherwise as a graduate student reveals a conflict in departmental messaging. On the UBC Geography website the "about" page declares:
    <br><br> 
         "We take an interdisciplinary approach to the study of the natural environment... Our goal is cutting-edge research that matters and makes a difference, intellectually and practically." (geog.ubc.ca/about)
         <br><br>
    As a discipline which awards degrees in both arts and science, geography is an inherently interdisciplinary field of study. But what does that actually look like within a department and amongst geographers? Its "common knowledge" amongst UBC geography graduates that physical (grad) geographers and human (grad) geographers on the whole seldom interact socially (let alone engage collaboratively). Indeed, our offices are on separate floors. What does interdisciplinary mean in practice for geographers (graduate students and faculty alike)? Though my research draws from many disciplines, I argue is not simply interdisciplinary, but transdisciplinary. A polydisciplinamorous orientation, even.
    <br><br>  
        "Traditional interdisciplinary, with its intertheory thrust, could be said to be about _who_ (which disciplines) one commits to, while research-creation, as a _polydisciplinamorous_ orientation, becomes about _how_ one commits to producing new kinship ties not only in terms of _content_ (the "who") but in terms of _form_ (the "how"). Natalie Loveless in her Manifesto for Research Creation (2019, 63)
        <br><br>
    The MA graduate program overview insists on being "flexible, research-intensive, and student-driven" (geog.ubc.ca/graduate/masters-programs/ma-geography). Yet what happens for graduate students pursuing practice-based geography/research-creation endeavors like me when it comes time to submit 'the final thesis' to cIRcle, the submission platform contracted by UBC?   
    <br><br>
    Well, as per cIRcle upload instructions (https://bit.ly/3WyV6LE) the MA thesis must be formatted the following way:
    <br><br><br><br>
      ubc_gradyear_gradmonth_lastname_firstname.pdf 

      <br><br><br><br>
    Submitting a research "product" in any other (file) form(at) such as image, sound, or *interactive resource* is restricted to MFA students (https://bit.ly/3I827yk). Submitting as one's thesis a collection containing both text a non-text is for "CREATIVE ARTS ONLY" (capital letters signal caution on instructional website). Finally, the caution: "Please note: It is your responsibility to meet all submission requirements. If the thesis does not meet formatting requirements it will not be approved."
        <br><br>
    How can practice based research be valued if a creative output, integrated together with text or separate, is not even viable for submission? The expectation that research process be rendered down into a distilled text.pdf whereby process is relegated to the negative space of an outcome - to evaporated matter - is engrained in the system no matter the "flexibility" and "interdisciplinary" the program signals. What modes of making difference and what differences matter (enough) to the department become apparent when it comes time for research outcomes to be submitted for evaluation. As a graduate student, to enact otherwise - to produce knowledge differently - means risking not only legibility & intelligibility, but acceptance of one's research value by the institution at a juncture where degree rejection (potentially) excises you from academia.

        Hot air rises. This is because it is less dense than cold air. Hot air is lese dense than cold air because the molecules that make up quote air are more dispersed. I learned this in science class when I was fifteen but I don't know how the scientists figured all these things out. Maybe they were sitting, like me, in a room on the top floor of a building and feeling hot. They must have known it was quote hot they were feeling by way their skin felt like it were throbbing all over––that membrane meant to encase them now opening around each body hair to leak heady secretions into the sterile space between them. Since quote cold is sensed also by the skin they must also have already experienced this sensation and agreed the current feeling was not the same. They must also have shared the presupposition that temperature is a gradient, agreeing that while downstairs did not feel quote cold per se, it did not feel quote quite as hot as it did upstairs. They were writing science and we are writing of writing science, yes. But, if a scientist were in the room with us right now, guessing the precise millimeters of mercury aside , I can, with a confidence interval of one hundred percent, say they would agree it feels hot in here.
