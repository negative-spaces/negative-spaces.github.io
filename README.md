What could it mean to think with place? To feel the city? I explore and respond to these questions through deep mapping, or situated, embodied inhabitation as a practice of ongoing and open-ended dialogue with the world. Deep mapping is not defined by opposition so much as articulated through iterative acts of interference with hegemonic forms of representing place, producing geographic knowledge, and rendering spatial research public. This is my theory, at least. My master's research-creation amounts to cultivating a practice of deep mapping, theorizing my interpretation of this capacious practice through practice, and enacting my theory as praxis.
