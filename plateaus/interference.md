# Interference
[initial notes](../mindpalace/interference.txt)

Deep mapping does not render down to a map in the cartesian sense, where action is made legible by the substitution of trace for practice (de Certeau). Indeed, "very little of what deep mappers are doing is in fact oriented towards the production of maps so much as immersing themselves in the warp and weft of a lived and fundamentally intersubjective spatiality" (Roberts 2018). 

However, neither does Deep mapping does not "counter cartography" - not defined by opposition so much as through iterative acts of interference with hegemonic, top-down forms of ENGAGING & REPRESENTING PLACE, PRODUCING GEOGRAPHIC KNOWLEDGE, and RENDERING SPATIAL RESEARCH PUBLIC.  

Not outside the field but interfering generatively from within at boundary of legibility. 

Vignette: Bubble at wreck beach   
<video src="../media/field/thinfilm-interference.mp4" controls="autoplay" style="width: 50%;"></video>

Some grey day last winter I walked the stretch of shoreline that wraps around the traditional, ancestral, unceded territory of the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam) First Nations. I am here because from where the sand turns dry begins the land occupied by the University of British Columbia. With the Salish sea on one side and a forest of evergreens and sword ferns to the other, the university at which I am a graduate student is geographically and administratively separated from the city of Vancouver. The beach is the only spot on campus I can breathe easily, where I can think. A five minute walk from the Geography Department takes me to a zig-zag staircase at the bottom of which awaits a place where clothing is optional. My shoes and socks are the first to come off. The sand is cold and firm, yet porous. It holds the impression of my soles and reshapes in my hands. I contain it for a moment - appreciating the texture worn from time and force - then release it. How freeing to exist in a landscape with nothing (on) but the body. 

Sensorium is the initial mechanism by which I receive data from my surroundings. I walk the shoreline to feel something visceral. "Deep mapping... presupposed the embodied presence of the researcher 'within' the space under investigation." (Roberts 2018, 11). s/c/iting the body as reference. 
   
Sunshine was a precious thing my first winter settled in Vancouver when it rained for four months straight. The cloud cover was so dense that a dimple of white was the only indication our star remained. Monochrome days used to really kill my vibe. There’s a dullness to a landscape lit ambiently, a non-differentiation that makes it difficult to articulate thoughts. That day I paused at ocean’s edge where barnacles encrust the rocks and molluscs cling together in crunchy bundles. In and out rolled the waves, and I breathed with them. On each exhale I noticed how foam gathered around the rocks at my feet, forming bubbles on whose surface spun psychedelic spirals. This happens due to thin film interference, where light waves reflecting off the surface of a bubble are interfered with by waves which have been transmitted through the film, reflected back, and refracted at the surface at the angle of incidence. When refracted waves are shifted so as to be in-synch with those reflected, they interfere constructively to make visible an abundance of colors. [sketch reference diagram] 

Introduce destructive interference; 

Deep mapping is interference with the superficial reflection that is place rendered (down) by flat maps.

Interference pattern --> diffraction

    "Diffraction does not produce "the same" displaced, as reflection and refraction do. Diffraction is a mapping of interference, not of replica­ tion, reflection, or reproduction. A diffraction pattern does not map where differences appear, but rather maps where the effects of difference appear. "  ‘Promises of Monsters’ p 70

    "Diffraction patterns record the history of interaction, interference, reinforcement, difference. Diffraction is about heterogeneous history, not about originals. Unlike reflections, diffractions do not displace the same elsewhere, in more or less distorted form, thereby giving rise to industries of metaphysics. Rather, diffraction can be a metaphor for another kind of critical consciousness at the end of this rather painful Christian millennium, one committed to making a difference and not to repeating the Sacred Image of Same. Diffraction is askew of Christian narrative and Platonist optics, in their sacred secular technoscientific story cycles as well as their more orthodox manifestations. Diffraction is a narrative, graphic, psychological, spiritual, and political technology for making consequential meanings." (Haraway 2018, 273)
