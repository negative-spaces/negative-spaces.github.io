        <i>Many stories exist in the landscape</i>, says a wooden frame erected at Jericho Beach Park, <i>What do you see?</i> Do different stories render different cities? Or is it, as so exquisitely suggested by Italo Calvino's Invisible Cities (1974), that different framings focus a city differently, evoking a multiplicity of stories, each one rendering some aspects of a landscape legible to the exclusion of others? 
      </p>

      <p>
        I am a bricoleur-as-researcher, conducting transdisciplinary investigations into everyday urban geographies through both affective and technoscientific research practices. I craft multimodal artifacts which perform bricolage with the physical-conceptual fields of my encounter. Through the course of my master's research-creation, I have explored and responded to the question: What could it mean to think <i>with</i> place? to <i>feel</i> the city? I have done so through deep mapping, or situated, embodied inhabitation as a practice of ongoing and open-ended dialogue within and as part of the world. Deep mapping does not counter cartography in the sense of it not being defined through opposition. Rather, deep mapping is a capacious practice marked by iterative acts of interference with hegemonic forms of representing place, producing geographic knowledge, and rendering spatial research public. My theory of deep mapping is constituted through my practice of deep mapping. I believe deep mapping to be a Baradian 'diffractive apparatus' (Barad 2007), for at times it is the object of my investigation and at times, the instrument. Deep mapping has proved a means to investigate the entangled state of limit and transgression, as well as that of trace and practice.

        I have submitted as my MA thesis in geography a file entitled ubc_2024_may_crandalloral_lilydemet_negative-spaces.zip, as well as a brief .pdf document containing metadata and instructions on how to unzip my thesis file. The unzipped folder negative-spaces and the webbed site constituted through intra-action with the contents therein mark a partial account of my deep mapping practice. Its articulation as an object of knowledge is the effect of multiple boundary making practices. What becomes intelligible as a thesis is not an innocent matter, however, for the constitution of a determinate form entails the exclusion of all other/ed possible configurations. Through the course of my master's research-creation I realized what is needed to produce 'situated knowledges' (Haraway 1988) of the place one inhabits is not reflexivity on the part of the geographer-cartographer-researcher, or merely an approach which counters the hegemonic one, but an account of <i>how</i> differences come to matter as the effects of interferences. I want to suggest "the city" as a phenomenon within which empirical formations (themselves phenomena) like spatial data and maps (be they mental or physical/digital) are intra-actively produced through both technoscientific and affective agencies of observation. 'Top down' and 'bottom up' mapping practices simply perform different agential cuts, the effects of which do not oppose one another but overlap in the everyday, their interference constituting the entangled viscera of urban bodies as they are rendered differentially intelligible. To study phenomena, their entangled states, and/or the apparatuses performing agential cuts from an exterior position, however, requires building a larger diffractive apparatus (Barad 2007, 345). This is what I intend to do in my PhD. I want to build a diffractive apparatus to study how the phenomenal city comes to differentially matter through the entangled effects of 'top down' and 'bottom up' boundary making practices. Reimagining referent "the city" from a fixed and bounded object to a phenomenon, dynamically figured through the posthuman performativity of 'iterative intra-activity' (Barad 2007), allows for a multiplicity of stories to be superpositioned in one place. The indeterminacy of which story comes to matter is resolved by boundary making practices which differentially frame the landscape. Accounting for boundary making practices is important in order to remain responsive to how some stories become privileged while others are "excluded from mattering" (Barad 2007, 220).

        After my spring symposium presentation to my department I was asked by another graduate student: "Are you more of a wave or a particle?" All I could think to say then was "interesting how you've framed the question as an either or..." I've been holding the question in mind since - subconsciously mostly - until a thought came one morning like the momentary illumination of lighting: I am (we are all) <i>both</i> wave and particle. Although routinely apprehended as individuals with definite bodies whose boundaries preexist encounter, our contours are really permeable, provisional, composed and continuously recomposed through iterative intra-actions. Interference patterns, or diffraction patterns, mark is the superposition of different intelligibilities. To practice deep mapping is to embody superposition. My interference praxis has revealed entanglements to be the "poetics of paradox and ambiguity essential to open deep mapping" (Modeen and Biggs 2020, 53). Paradox is not a closure but an opening - to possibilities - the existence of entangled states, simultaneous multiplicities, inextricable layers.

      Much of my fieldwork has involved navigating Vancouver, my empirics emerging as inextricable layerings of sensorium, affect, and infrastructure. Alongside my thesis I have TAed a departmental cartography course as well as completed cartographic research assistance and freelance cartography. I also work in the university library Research Commons, teaching and consulting on geospatial matters as well as developing and facilitating workshops on mapping and geographic information systems (GIS). 
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the workshops I led for the library was on building walkability indexes with GIS (“Network Analysis,” n.d.). GIS, or geographic information systems, are the computational programs, desktop applications, and infrastructural hardware that facilitate the distribution, visualization, and analysis of geospatial data. Geospatial data are data for which a locational property, such as coordinate or street address, is measured. Much like excel assists in performing mathematical calculations on numerical datasets or Nvivo helps highlight patterns across qualitative records, GIS assist in performing spatial analysis on georeferenced datasets. A walkability index is a quantitative assessment of the relative accessibility of amenities within a delineated area. The workshop assumed as its empirics geospatial datasets which render the city down from above as a collection of points, lines, and polygons. Indeed, it is possible to make the  entire index without any reference to on-the-ground, everyday navigations. Given geospatial data representing Vancouver's city blocks, population density, and amenities, GIS provides the tools to analyze proximity and connection, as well as visualize the result through a map.
    </p>
    <p>
      Around the same time as I was preparing to present the walkability workshop, I began noticing these '15 minute City <span style="font-weight:500">Ready</span>' stickers popping up along the Vancouver Greenway, a stretch of the old Canadian Pacific railroad that's been transposed into a designated pedestrian and bike path. Conceptualized by city planner Carlos Moreno, the '15 minute city' is the idea “that cities should be designed or redesigned so that, within the distance of a 15-minute walk or bike ride, people should be able to live the essence of what constitutes the urban experience: to access work, housing, food, health, education, culture and leisure” (Moreno 2020). Over the course of the spring, more stickers appeared, pasted over DO NOT ENTER EXCEPT BICYCLES signs and those yellow/black striped hazard markers. At the same time that the stickers began proliferating east, west, and even across the bridge into downtown, they also began being scratched off. Reapplication, however, was swift. Then I sighted something different: at first one then two sites, scrawled in blue sharpie over '15 minute City <span style="font-weight:500">Ready</span>' was the declaration RESIST.
      </p>

      <p>
        But resist what? Well it turns out the '15 minute City <span style="font-weight:500">Ready</span>' stickers are actually in protest of the ‘15 minute city’––the decal’s chain-link background representing enforced limited mobility. The location and surface of the stickers' placement is therefore significant. The signification of protest comes to matter through the stickers’ material-semiotic interference with infrastructural boundary demarcations. City signs become palimpsests––sites of super/im/position signaling contested urbanisms. This led me to think about how proximity and connection are measured, the city imagined, and urban space produced through both technoscientific and affective spatial practices.
