<div class="vignette" style="width:700px; margin:auto">
  Nothing is where I left it. I get up for a walk or eat or rest and when I return the words are there but I've forgotten what they meant. Is my thesis just writing about writing a thesis? Or doing fieldwork? I know I thought it all meant something yesterday. I felt it, at least. I had six ideas before noon and but then I read the last chapter of this book and now I'm not so sure what matters. Is it all very simple and elegantly connected from the start? Or is it a tangled snarl of threads which no amount of good writing can unravel. Topology shifts with something so simple as a bikeride along an unfamiliar route. The city and my framework rearranges ever so slightly, coheres, connects back to something last visited a year ago. My working memory can hold no more than four things at a time which makes writing a thesis where everything is connected and also layered and happening all at once very challenging. I don't think one sentence at a time. I feel ideas and their connections, wake up with words in my mouth, and then iterate through phrasings until I land on an arrangement of words and punctuation that best approximates the feeling. And then I write around this grain until a pearl of something is said. I'm trying to practice writing around nothing (yet) - not waiting for the grains to start writing but just saying whatever's on my mind when I feel stuck and seeing if it goes anywhere. It's all the field - every feeling a world in the process of becoming.

        <b>TACTICS</b><br><br>
        The eclectic toolkit of a bricoleur is needed to expand the field from within, interfering with systems and structures which delimit intelligibility not through oppositional strategies but with tactics appropriate to the situation at hand.
