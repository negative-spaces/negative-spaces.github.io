        <span style="margin-left: 27%;"><b>MAKING SPACE FOR DEEP MAPPING: THEORY AS PRAXIS</b></span>
        <br><br>
        I have come to understand being a geographer as less of an ability to know where you are in space at all times and more of a capacity to learn through disorientation. Like many colleagues, I began graduate school in a place I’d ever been before and where I knew no one. As teaching assistant for a departmental cartography course, I was responsible for introducing and evaluating assignments, as well as demonstrating the use of required software. The first assignment: to make a map of downtown Vancouver by tracing a screenshot from Google Maps in Adobe Illustrator. I graded sixty of these maps before finally venturing to the place they represented. Having inhabited Vancouver for nearly two years now and taught this assignment nine times, I find Google’s basemap incongruous with my mental map of the city drawn through lived experience. Navigational maps, writes Laura Kurgan “impos[] a quiet tyranny of orientation that erases the possibility of disoriented discovery… they omit, according to their conventions, those invisible lines of people, places, and networks that create the most common spaces we live in today” (2009, 16-17). Indeed, spatial awareness of my surroundings has evolved not by following Google Maps from A to B or memorizing the contours it renders down from above, but rather through becoming lost and wandering around. Thus disoriented, I find areas of familiarity connected in surprising ways. I realized that the city does not exist as a defined and bounded object. It is not a fieldsite which pre-exists my encounter and which I, the geographer-researcher, may separate myself from in order to map from a distanced, exterior position. Rather, my navigations performatively constitute the city as a physical-conceptual field of encounter.
        <br><br>
        <i>How, then, might knowledge generated through everyday spatial practices be rendered without being flattened,
        georeferenced, or vectorized?</i> This page introduces <span
            style="opacity: .6">github.com/negative-spaces/</span>negative-spaces.github.io, the web-site and
        constitutive <a href="https://github.com/negative-spaces/negative-spaces.github.io">code repository</a> which I will submit as my masters thesis. Taken together, this web-field-site will
        convey what I have learned thinking <i>with</i> place in a rhizomatic form akin to the interconnectedness of physical and
        conceptual topoi which lure me to disoriented discovery. In what follows, I articulate how my theorization of
        deep mapping––constituted through my practice of deep mapping––is enacted in both the form and formation of
        negative-spaces.github.io. By locating my work in negative space, I aim valorize ways of being and operating in the world (and academy) that are often relegated to negative space––to other than an intelligible form. I share a space still very much under construction because I believe the journey is as much a site  for learning as is the destination. 
        <br><br>
        Deep mapping does not render down to a ‘map’ in the sense of a cartesian cartography, where action is made legible by the substitution of trace for practice (de Certeau 1984, 97). It is a spatial practice which eludes operationalization its interpretive capaciousness, though becoming lost and wandering around is an excellent state wherein to begin. Mapping deeply attends to spatial anthropology, "the processes whereby the fundamental spatiality of being is woven into and from everyday practices, dispositions and experiential knowledge” (Roberts 2018, 30). For me, deep mapping is a practice of situated, embodied inhabitation through which I enter into dialogue with my surroundings. Pressing my chest against the Granville Bridge I feel at once its trembling vibration and my own heart’s rapid beating. I embody a sonic superposition: vibrational waves overlap; interfere; combine. The rhythm of their resulting wave marks a pattern of interference, also called a diffraction pattern. Boundaries of bodies human and nonhuman are refigured during visceral encounter. I became entangled with the infrastructure which, heretofore, I had approached only as an instrument to support an abstract vantage. I leave the bridge holding a little of my warmth and bring away with me this idea. . .
        <br><br>
        Deep mapping as I have come to theorize (with) it does not ‘counter cartography’ (cf. Mason-Deese 2020); it is not defined by opposition so much as through iterative acts of interference with hegemonic forms of engaging/representing place, producing geographic knowledge, and rendering spatial research public. Understood this way, deep mapping is a diffractive apparatus for making interferences and studying how they come to matter (Barad 2007). “knowing, thinking, measuring, theorizing, and observing are material practices of intra-acting within and as part of the world” (Barad 2007, 90). Deep mapping disorients representationalist dualisms by assuming the field, in all configurings of encounter, as interlocutor. As such, the topoi (places) wherewith I think cannot be instantaneously apprehended as the nominal (d & g) City, nor can they be captured by the frame of a single map. Neither is one existing disciplinary framework or methodology sufficient: each time I leave home I bring along the people/stories/theories I wish to think with for the day. Often, I bring more than one book. I put texts into conversation first amongst themselves. In my bag, their pages interlap, folding together like a pair of hands bookmarking one another. Opening one, I open myself: Read me. My field-site is iteratively drawn by the lines of connection I make––a topology continuously transforming through intra-action. It is this relational entanglement that is at stake in rendering thinking through practice. Form matters. So does the process of formation. Making space for deep mapping therefore presents a site for enacting theory as praxis, for committing iterative acts of interference using tactics from the field. (It’s all
        the field, as is the refrain of my interlocutor in the audience and I.)
        <br><br>
        Tactics are methods whose validity is measured by their applicability to the situation at hand (de Certeau 1984). Appropriate use of tactics therefore depends on practical, experiential knowledge gleaned through everyday navigations of terrains physical, conceptual, and digital. In both field-research and site-creation I employ tactics of bricolage––the poetics of making do with what tools, skills, and materials are already around (Roberts 2018). For example, instead of learning everything about coding and styling webpages before building my web-field-site, I teach myself what I need as I go, often gleaning (copypasting) snippets of open source code (as is custom) that are relevant to what I am attempting in the moment. Indeed, it is through my job in geospatial information and technology at the library that I learned to command the version control software I write with (git), and internet hosting service which renders visible my work (GitHub). The spatiality of git itself I will save for another time, but safe to say, it presents an intriguing phenomenon to think through local and remote as they pertain to questions of where/how character concatenations and code materialize. 
        <br><br>
        negative-spaces.github.io is itself a web-field-site for deep mapping, a space for nonlinear exploration following ideas that grasp and pull the visitor. Until now, I have used negative-spaces.github.io to invoke the entire site. However, pasting this address into a web browser will bring you only to an initial entry point. My argument unfolds across multiple pages, each page connected to a multiplicity of others via hyperlink at top and bottom of page. Each page differs in structure. Format matters. Rendering within a digital context allows space to build for a variety of creative syncretisms. Multimedia, rather than being relegated to an appendix, are integrated directly with text. Indeed, as Cliffard McLucas (2000) said, “Deep maps will only be achieved by the articulation of a variety of media––they will be genuinely multimedia, not as an aesthetic gesture or affectation, but as a practical necessity.” My use of Github as a host platform was inspired by sultanazana.github.io, whose “network of webpages will grow more tangled with time.” Conventionally used for managing code development for software projects, I chose Github to host my thesis because it makes the process of my site construction visible. The code repository which constitutes my web-site contains folders for multimedia, text drafting, and the styling sheet responsible for the appearance of my website and which itself develops in response to dynamic styling needs. My repository contains the html documents which, once read by web browsers, comprise what’s read by browsers of my web-site. Within each page of my web-site is a link to its constitutive code document in the repository. In this way, process is embedded in the elements of product.
        <br><br>
        Upload and archival of my thesis is requiring an actual restructuring (re-coding) of the platform contracted by my university to publish graduate research. This means the web-field-site through which I render my theory of deep mapping as interference with systemically other/ed forms of representing place, producing geographic knowledge, and rendering spatial research public is, itself, interfering generativity with the system from within, and in so doing, enacting theory as praxis.
