Vignette: Bubble at wreck beach   
<video src="../media/field/thinfilm-interference.mp4" controls="autoplay" style="width: 50%;"></video>
January 2022; First conception of deep mapping as (constructive) interference - stepping "into" the field as it were, diffracting, and interfering with superficial reflections (basemap) to produce a cartography beyond the monochrome. Diffraction is when a wave meets obstacle or opening --> passes through --> bends --> waves interfere --> diffraction pattern aka interference pattern. 

*go into ATP with constructive and destructive interference*

Some grey day last winter I walked the stretch of shoreline that wraps around the traditional, ancestral, unceded territory of the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam) First Nations. I am here because from where the sand turns dry begins the land occupied by the University of British Columbia. With the Salish sea on one side and a forest of evergreens and sword ferns to the other, the university at which I am a graduate student is geographically and administratively separated from the city of Vancouver. The beach is the only spot on campus I can breathe easily, where I can think. A five minute walk from the Geography Department takes me to a zig-zag staircase at the bottom of which awaits a place where clothing is optional. My shoes and socks are the first to come off. The sand is cold and firm, yet porous. It holds the impression of my soles and reshapes in my hands. I contain it for a moment - appreciating the texture worn from time and force - then release it. How freeing to exist in a landscape with nothing (on) but the body. 

Sensorium is the initial mechanism by which I receive data from my surroundings. I walk the shoreline to feel something visceral. "Deep mapping... presupposed the embodied presence of the researcher 'within' the space under investigation." (Roberts 2018, 11). s/c/iting the body as reference. 
   
Sunshine was a precious thing my first winter settled in Vancouver when it rained for four months straight. The cloud cover was so dense that a dimple of white was the only indication our star remained. Monochrome days used to really kill my vibe. There’s a dullness to a landscape lit ambiently, a non-differentiation that makes it difficult to articulate thoughts. That day I paused at ocean’s edge where barnacles encrust the rocks and molluscs cling together in crunchy bundles. In and out rolled the waves, and I breathed with them. On each exhale I noticed how foam gathered around the rocks at my feet, forming bubbles on whose surface spun psychedelic spirals. This happens due to thin film interference, where light waves reflecting off the surface of a bubble are interfered with by waves which have been transmitted through the film, reflected back, and refracted at the surface at the angle of incidence. When refracted waves are shifted so as to be in-synch with those reflected, they interfere constructively to make visible an abundance of colors. [sketch reference diagram] 

Introduce destructive interference; 

Deep mapping is interference with the superficial reflection that is place rendered (down) by flat maps.

Interference pattern --> diffraction

    "Diffraction does not produce "the same" displaced, as reflection and refraction do. Diffraction is a mapping of interference, not of replica­ tion, reflection, or reproduction. A diffraction pattern does not map where differences appear, but rather maps where the effects of difference appear. "  ‘Promises of Monsters’ p 70

    "Diffraction patterns record the history of interaction, interference, reinforcement, difference. Diffraction is about heterogeneous history, not about originals. Unlike reflections, diffractions do not displace the same elsewhere, in more or less distorted form, thereby giving rise to industries of metaphysics. Rather, diffraction can be a metaphor for another kind of critical consciousness at the end of this rather painful Christian millennium, one committed to making a difference and not to repeating the Sacred Image of Same. Diffraction is askew of Christian narrative and Platonist optics, in their sacred secular technoscientific story cycles as well as their more orthodox manifestations. Diffraction is a narrative, graphic, psychological, spiritual, and political technology for making consequential meanings." (Haraway 2018, 273)

Ideas, diffracting upon encountering Barad a year later --> understanding deep mapping as interference in general, both destructive and constructive 

>Haraway - diffractions is a category of semantics:
"Diffraction does not produce "the same" displaced, as reflection and refraction do. Diffraction is a mapping of interference, not of replica­tion, reflection, or reproduction. A diffraction pattern does not map where differences appear, but rather maps where the effects of difference appear." (Haraway 2020, 70)
"Diffraction patterns record the history of interaction, interference, reinforcement, difference." (Haraway 2018, 273)

> (Barad 2007, 185): "There is an important sense in which practices of knowing cannot fully be claimed as human practices, not simply because we use nonhuman elements in our practices but because knowing is a matter of part of the world making itself intelligible to another part. Practices of knowing and being are not isolable; they are mutually implicated. We don't obtain knowledge by standing outside the world; we know because we are of the world. We are part of the world in its differential becoming. The separation of epistemology from ontology is a reverberation of a metaphysics that assumes an inherent difference between human and nonhuman, subject and object, mind and body, matter and discourse. Onto-epistem-ology-the study of practices of knowing in being-is probably a better way to think about the kind of understandings that we need to come to terms with how specific intra­ actions matter. Or, for that matter, what we need is something like an ethico­ onto-epistem-ology-an appreciation of the intertwining of ethics, knowing, and being-since each intra-action matters, since the possibilities for what the world may become call out in the pause that precedes each breath before a moment comes into being and the world is remade again, because the becoming of the world is a deeply ethical matter." 



## Agential Realism - Apparatuses - Interference - Intra Acting 
Barad's agental realism (2007)
“knowing, thinking, measuring, theorizing, and observing are material practices of intra-acting within and as part of the world” (90).
"intelligibility is an ontological performance of the world in its ongoing articulation." (149)
"apparatuses are material-discursive practices-causal intra-actions through which matter is iteratively and diferentially articu­lated, reconfigurinn the material-discursive field of possibilities and impossibilities in the ongoing dynamics of intra-activity that is agency. Apparatuses are not bounded objects or structures; they are open-ended practices." (170)
Define: Diffractive Apparatus

Practicing deep mapping walking the bridge, observing context below. (connect with barad saying its not from above) 
"Knowing is not about seeing from above or outside or even seeing from a prosthetically enhanced human body. Knowing is a matter of intra-acting. Knowing entails specific practices through which the world is differentially articulated and accounted for. In some instances, "nonhumans" (even beings without brains) emerge as partaking in the world's active engagement in practices of knowing. Knowing entails
differential responsiveness and accountability as part of a network of performances. Knowing is not a bounded or closed practice but an ongoing performance of the world" (Barad 2007, 149): 

Pressing my chest against the Granville Bridge I feel at once its trembling vibration and my own heart’s rapid beating. I embody a sonic superposition: vibrational waves overlap; interfere; combine. The rhythm of their resulting wave marks a pattern of interference, also called a diffraction pattern. Through visceral encounter, I become entangled with the infrastructure which I had heretofore approached only as an abstracting vantage for rhythmanalysis. I leave the bridge holding a little of my warmth and bring away with me this idea…  Deep mapping as I enunciate it does not "counter cartography" (cf Mason-Deese 2020); It is not defined by opposition so much as through *iterative acts of interference* with hegemonic forms of engaging & representing place, producing geographic knowledge, and rendering spatial research public. Understood this way... `Deep mapping as a Baradian diffractive apparatus for generating interferences and studying how they (these patterns of difference) come to matter.`

Deep mapping is a praxis of diffraction––accounting for how research practices matter. 
Deep mapping is diffractive mapping - both site and tactic/ object and instrument of interference. the field is not a site separate from where spatial analyses are produced, maps rendered, and urban geography written. In my practice, with my thesis - I aim not to oppose cartography, the institution. I locate myself neither above nor outside the field, but rather within and as part of the world, my site of interference shifting so as to be always the line drawn at the limit of legibility - the boundary of the intelligible form.
