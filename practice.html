      <p style="margin-left:23%">
        What could it mean to think with place? To feel the city? How might the tactics of practical knowledge be employed to interfere with epistemological hegemonies from within? My master’s research is an exploration and response to these questions through deep mapping. The concept of 'deep maps' and 'deep mapping' was first conceived by Pearson and Shanks (2001, 162) through a multimedia performed lecture. For Pearson and Shanks (2001), <br><br>
        <span class="quote">
          the deep map attempts to record and represent the grain and patina of place through juxtapositions and interpenetrations of the historical and the contemporary, the political and the poetic, the factual and the fictional, the discursive and the sensual; the conflation of oral testimony, anthology, memoir, biography, natural history and everything you might ever want to say about a place. (65) 
        </span>
        <br>
        Les Roberts (2018) notes that 
        <br><br>
        <span class="quote">
          everything you might want to say may be voluminous, polyvocal or open-ended. Unlike the surface dimensions that delineate and give shape to the locational properties of place, verticality and depth denote a comparative absence of limitations. The deeper you go, the more layers you accrue. The problem becomes how to hold it all together: how to ‘frame’ it as a map. (49)
        </span>
        <br>
        I am not concerned with making a map or anything representative of my spatial practice. However, I have paid considerable attention to the boundary making practice involved in framing an object of knowledge, especially one which renders the effects of practice. My interest is not in deep maps as objects of knowledge but rather in deep mapping as a research practice. Deep mapping resists preemptive definition for it is <i>through</i> practice that it becomes articulated as an apparatus of investigation. This page is therefore an invitation to think through practice in order to arrive at a situated theory of practice. In what follows, I trace my theorization of deep mapping by entering into dialogue with the physical and conceptual fields of my encounter. This dialogue takes the form of a digital commonplace: embedded on the left are passages from the conceptual field; on the right, interpretations of deep mapping generated through navigating Vancouver. Similar to how Clifford McLucas wrote ten things about deep maps (2000), I share ten things about deep mapping I have come to know through the course of practice.

Dialogue is interference is the superposition of different intelligibilities. What is written, patterened, or rendered marks the effects of an ongoing and open-ended dialogue with the world.

          <br><br>
          Navigation makes navigable the field. 
          <br><br>
          To further describe the "iterative loops between action, experience, and knowledge" (Tuin and Verhoeff 2022, 138) which form my research (and whose form my research takes), I introduce the lemniscate: ∞ The lemniscate is a form I grew up drawing and walking as part of Waldorf School pedagogy. Beginning in first grade 1, along with 20 classmates, learned form drawing and Eurythmy. Eurythmy is "visible speech, visible music" / "music translated into movement" (Steiner 1923) - a spatial practice accompanied by piano whose every class began by walking a lemniscate for nearly ten minutes. Facing forward we flowed as one body in continuous motion. Although eurythmy was, without exception, our least favorite block, I have no doubt practicing it twice a week for eight years significantly developed my sense of spatial awareness. 
          <br><br>
          Also beginning in grade one was the practice of form drawing. Sitting in silence for an hour or more we would draw a form like the lemniscate over and over, the crayon in constant contact with the page. Form drawing is process oriented: "It is the _act_ of drawing that educates, not the result" (Gebert 1987, 8). **The embodied iteration of patterns was a fundamental mechanism by which representational subjects like writing and arithmetic were later taught.** My critiques of Waldorf pedagogy notwithstanding, I attribute my acute spatial awareness and orientation towards sensorium to my experience of "multisensory learning, where ears and eyes and voice, hands and feet, mind and memory, all work together to reinforce each other" (Gebert 1987, 12). The iteration of a form reveals beginning and end to be merely places of turning and return.
          <br><br>
          Practice is a commitment to transformation.

  My theory of deep mapping is constituted through my practice of deep mapping.

  That sentence took nine months of writing and re-writing. Indeed, I wrote that sentence while my theorization was still taking shape. What I'd finally found were words to state how my theory, the knowledge co-produced, the link between theory and practice and the what of my entire project - all emerge from my iteration through theory and practice. Situated. Embodied. With/In place.
