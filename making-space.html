            DIS/ORIENTATION<br><br>
            I have come to understand being a geographer as less of an ability to know where you are in space at all times and more of a capacity to learn through disorientation. Like many colleagues, I began graduate school in a place I’d never been before and where I knew no one. As teaching assistant for a departmental cartography course, I was responsible for introducing and evaluating assignments, as well as demonstrating the use of required software. The first assignment: to make a map of downtown Vancouver by tracing a screenshot from Google Maps in Adobe Illustrator. I graded sixty of these maps before I finally ventured to the place they represented. Having now inhabited Vancouver for nearly two years and taught this assignment nine times, I find Google’s basemap incongruous with my mental map of the city drawn from lived experience. Navigational maps, writes Laura Kurgan, “impos[e] a quiet tyranny of orientation that erases the possibility of disoriented discovery. . .” (2009, 16-17). Spatial awareness of my surroundings has evolved not by following Google Maps from A to B or memorizing its aerial contours, but rather through becoming lost and wandering around. Thus disoriented, I find areas of familiarity connected in surprising ways. I realize the city is not a bounded fieldsite which pre-exists my encounter and which I, the geographer-researcher, may separate myself from in order to map from a distanced, exterior position. Rather, my navigations performatively constitute the city as the physical-conceptual field of my encounter.
            <br><br>
            <i>How, then, might geographic knowledge generated through everyday spatial practices be rendered without being flattened,
            georeferenced, or vectorized?</i> This page introduces <span
            style="opacity: .6">github.com/negative-spaces/</span>negative-spaces.github.io, the web-site and constitutive <a href="https://github.com/negative-spaces/negative-spaces.github.io">code repository</a> which I will submit as my masters thesis. Taken together, this web-field-site will
            convey what I have learned thinking <i>with</i> the city in a rhizomatic form akin to the interconnectedness of physical and
            conceptual topoi (places) which lure me to disoriented discovery. In what follows, I articulate how my theorization of deep mapping––constituted through my practice of deep mapping––is enacted in both the form and formation of negative-spaces.github.io. In visual art, negative space is that which surrounds the subject but is not the intended focus of attention. For example, alleyways occupy negative space on Google’s street map. By locating my work in negative space, I aim to valorize ways of being and operating within the world (and academy) that are systemically relegated to other than intelligible forms. I share a space still very much under construction because I believe the journey to be as generative a site for learning as any destination.
            <br><br><br>
            THINKING THROUGH PRACTICE  
            <br><br>
            Deep mapping does not render down to ‘map’ in the sense of a cartesian cartography. Substituting a trace for practice, writes de Certeau, “exhibits the (voracious) property that the geographical system has of being able to transform action into legibility, but in doing so it causes a way of being in the world to be forgotten" (de Certeau 1984, 97). Deep mapping eludes definition in its interpretive capaciousness, though becoming lost and wandering around is an excellent state wherein to begin. For me, deep mapping has become a practice of situated, embodied inhabitation through which I enter into dialogue with my surroundings. Pressing my chest against the Granville Bridge I feel at once its trembling vibration and my own heart’s rapid beating. I embody a sonic superposition: vibrational waves overlap; interfere; combine. The rhythm of their resulting wave marks a pattern of interference, also called a diffraction pattern. Through visceral encounter, I become entangled with the infrastructure which, heretofore, I had approached only as an instrument from whose abstracting vantage I could conduct rhythmanalysis of the field below. I leave the bridge holding a little of my warmth and bring away with me this idea. . .
            <br><br>
            Deep mapping as I have come to theorize (with) it does not ‘counter cartography’ (cf. Mason-Deese 2020); it is not defined by opposition so much as through iterative acts of interference with hegemonic forms of engaging/representing place, producing geographic knowledge, and rendering spatial research public. Understood this way, deep mapping is a Baradian diffractive apparatus for making interferences and studying how these patterns of difference come to matter (Barad 2007). Deep mapping is an orientation to geography research which recognizes, as Barad does, that “knowing, thinking, measuring, theorizing, and observing are material practices of intra-acting within and as part of the world” (Barad 2007, 90). Deep mapping disorients representationalist dualisms by assuming the field of encounter as interlocutor. As such, my field cannot be instantaneously apprehended as the nominal (d & g) City, nor can it be captured by the frame of a single map. Neither is one existing disciplinary framework or methodology sufficient: each time I leave home I bring along the people/stories/theories I wish to think with for the day. Often, I bring more than one book. I put texts into conversation first amongst themselves. In my bag, their pages interlap, folding together like a pair of hands. Opening one, I open myself: <span style="text-decoration: line-through">README.md</span>Transform me. My field is the emergent web of connections drawing together (with) physical and conceptual topoi––a topology continuously transforming through intra-action. It is this relational entanglement that is at stake in rendering <i>thinking through practice</i>. Form matters. So does the process of formation and transformation. (It’s all the field, as is the refrain of my interlocutor in the audience and I.)
            <br><br><br>
            FORM & FORMATION - site/s and tactic/s of interference
            <br><br>
            negative-spaces.github.io is itself a webbed field for deep mapping, a space for nonlinear exploration following ideas that grasp and pull the visitor. Until now, I have used this address to invoke the entire site. However, pasting this link into a web browser will bring you to an initial entry point only. My argument will unfold across multiple pages, each page connecting to a multiplicity of others via hyperlinks. Building within a digital context allows me flexibility to format each page in a manner best suited to the content needing rendering. Multimedia, rather than being relegated to an appendix, are integrated directly with text. My use of Github as a host platform was inspired by sultanazana.github.io, whose “network of webpages will grow more tangled with time.” Conventionally used for managing code development for software projects, I chose Github because the code repository renders visible the iterative process of my site’s formation as well as the content which constitutes its rendered form.  
            <br><br>
            I know how to make web maps, wield GIS, and construct cartesian cartographies. What I didn’t know a year ago was how I would render a geography in process and of process without tracing out my practice in a linear text.pdf. Tactics are methods whose validity is measured by their applicability to the situation at hand (de Certeau 1984). Appropriate use of tactics therefore depends on practical, experiential knowledge gleaned through everyday navigations of terrains physical, conceptual, and digital. In both field-research and site-creation I employ tactics of bricolage––the poetics of making do with what tools, skills, and materials are already around (Roberts 2018a). For example, instead of learning everything about coding and styling webpages before building my web-site, I teach myself what I need as I go, often gleaning (copypasting) snippets of open source code (as is custom) that are relevant to what I am attempting in the moment. Moreover, I picked up knowledge of Github and git, the version control software I write with, through my job in geospatial information and technology at the university library. Mapping deeply cultivates an awareness of what is around, gleaning information that may become useful later on. Connections between contexts become apparent through the process of overlaying & interweaving different ways of thinking and doing.<!--mentally noting what could be made use of in what ways in the case of a relevant situation arising.In practice, deep mapping generates connections between contexts by overlaying different ways of thinking and doing. --> 
            <br><br><br>
            THEORY AS PRAXIS
            <br><br>
            After deciding the form of my thesis output I connected with the coordinator for my university’s public scholar’s initiative because as it stands, MA theses must be submitted as linear PDFs in order to be approved. As a result of our conversation, the platform contracted by my university to publish graduate research will be restructuring their system to make space to upload and archive my web-field-site. This means the site which renders my theory of deep mapping as interference with systemic norms of research intelligibility and legibility will serve also as a tactic for interference within and as part of the system. In ways that continue to surprise me, making space for deep mapping enacts deep mapping as praxis. This AAG session on experimental digital mapping has been split into two panels: Theory and Practice. Although I speak to you during the former, my theoretical interference comes to matter only through practical application. I thank you for finding your way here today. But before you leave Denver, do make room to get lost and wander around. There is no knowing where disorientation may take you.

                their paths (here well-trodden, there very faint) and their trajectories (going this way and not that).
                But these thick or thin curves only refer, like words, to the absence of what has passed by. <span

                only a relic set in the nowhen of a surface of projection. Itself visible, it has the effect of making
                invisible the operation that made it possible. These fixations constitute procedures for forgetting.
