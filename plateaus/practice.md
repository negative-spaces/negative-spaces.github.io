from [disorientation](./disorientation.md): **Spatial awareness** of my surroundings has evolved not by following Google's Map from A to B or memorizing its aerial contours, but rather through becoming lost and wandering around. Thus disoriented, I find areas of familiarity connected in surprising ways. Thus disoriented, I find areas of familiarity connected in surprising ways. I realize the city is not a fixed and inherently bounded object which pre-exists my encounter and which I, the geographer-researcher, may separate myself from in order to map from a distanced, exterior position. Rather, the city is physical-conceptual field whose emergent topology is performatively constituted through my everyday navigations. What if the field were not a site separate from where spatial analyses are produced, maps rendered, and urban geography written? Bringing this orientation to the ground, as praxis, means assuming the field of encounter (the city, as encountered if you will) as **interlocutor.** I invoke **research-creation** to initiate such a dialogue with the world, asking, *What could it mean to think *with* place, to *feel* the city?*

# Thinking through Practice 

I explore and respond to these questions through urban **deep mapping, a practice of situated, embodied inhabitation by which I enter into dialogue with my surroundings** 

Deep mapping attends to **spatial anthropology,** what Les Roberts (2018b, 30) calls an attempt to name "the processes whereby the fundamental spatiality of being is woven into and from everyday practices, dispositions and experiential knowledge. To proceed on these terms ... is to understand and practice space as an existential ground of everyday being." 

Deep mapping does not render down to a map in the cartesian sense, where action is made legible by the substitution of trace for practice (de Certeau). Indeed, "very little of what deep mappers are doing is in fact oriented towards the production of maps so much as immersing themselves in the warp and weft of a lived and fundamentally intersubjective spatiality" (Roberts). 

A mode of spatial analysis that accounts for rhythms that exceed measure, as they emerge in tension with time signatures; practical knowledge gleaned through practices of everyday life. layers that form depth of city inseparable - unlike discrete data layers loaded into GISystem for analysis, manipulation     
## Process Oriented 
Process oriented, slow scholarship?: Praxis based research.

Deep mapping is research-creation for my exploration is driven by intellectual and spatial topoi which lure me forwards even before I comprehend where they lead (Loveless 2019, 95). 
Following a concept in multiple directions I find myself making surprising connections. I write "follow" because when I loosen my desire to arrive at a specific place, when I release control of the destination as it were, I make room for latent connections to make themselves (apparent).  
    
Exploration, put one way, is "the action of traveling in or through an unfamiliar area in order to learn about it" (https://bit.ly/3XeFxZw). Deep mapping is a practice of learning through disorientation. Though the field, geographical or conceptual, is at first unfamiliar, the iterative act of navigating, of finding ways around, coheres a framework of reference points which constitute whats known of the field - the field of encounter. 
    
        "...navigation itself produces knowledge that feeds into its course and experience itself." (Tuin and Verhoeff 2022, 137-139) 

My theory of deep mapping is constituted through my practice of deep mapping. 

That sentence took nine months of writing and re-writing. That sentence, not my theory. Indeed, I wrote that sentence while still forming my theorization. I just had finally found words to state how my theory, the knowledge I produce, what my thesis is actually about - it all emerges from the iteration through theory and practice. 

To further describe the "iterative loops between action, experience, and knowledge" (Tuin and Verhoeff 2022, 138) which form my research (and whose form my research takes) I introduce the Lemniscate: 

∞

The lemniscate is a form I grew up drawing and walking as part of Waldorf pedagogy. Beginning in first grade 1, along with 20 classmates, learned form drawing and Eurythmy. Eurythmy is "visible speech, visible music" / "music translated into movement" (Steiner 1923) - a spatial practice accompanied by piano whose every class began by walking a lemniscate for nearly ten minutes. Facing forward we flowed as one body in continuous motion. Although eurythmy was, without exception, our least favorite block, I have no doubt practicing it twice a week for eight years significantly developed my sense of spatial awareness. Also beginning in grade one was the practice of form drawing. Sitting in silence for an hour or more we would draw a form like the lemniscate over and over, the crayon in constant contact with the page. Form drawing is process oriented: "It is the _act_ of drawing that educates, not the result" (Gebert 1987, 8). The embodied iteration of patterns was a fundamental mechanism by which representational subjects like writing and arithmetic were later taught. My critiques of Waldorf pedagogy notwithstanding, I attribute my acute spatial awareness and orientation towards sensorium to my experience of "multisensory learning, where ears and eyes and voice, hands and feet, mind and memory, all work together to reinforce each other" (Gebert 1987, 12).


### Theorization from Practice
From my iteration through theory and practice by which I think together/with the physical-conceptual  fields of my encounter, offer an interpretation of deep mapping that serves for now, for this project:

```
deep mapping is a praxis of interference with hegemonic forms of ENGAGING & REPRESENTING PLACE, PRODUCING GEOGRAPHIC KNOWLEDGE, and RENDERING SPATIAL RESEARCH PUBLIC
``` 

>"How we do, think about, think-with our research practices—be they written, spoken, or danced—matters." (Loveless 2019, 70)

That is what this project is about. Not a cartography, a trace of practice, a fixation operationalization or method, but an interference, a praxis, a doing and thinking (about) deep mapping
