# Deep Mapping Theory As Praxis

 What could it mean to think with place? To feel the city? How might the tactics of practical knowledge be employed to interfere with epistemological hegemonies from within? My master’s research is an exploration and response to these questions through deep mapping, a practice of situated, embodied inhabitation by which I enter into dialogue with my surroundings. My thesis project amounts to cultivating my practice of deep mapping, theorizing my interpretation of this capacious practice through practice, and enacting my theory as praxis. Deep mapping does not ‘counter cartography;’ yet neither does it render down to a flat map in the Cartesian sense. As I theorize it, deep mapping is not defined in opposition so much as marked by iterative acts of interference with hegemonic forms of representing place, producing geographic knowledge, and rendering spatial research public. What is rendered here is not a substitution for practice but the effects of continued practice, a partial account of an ongoing and open-ended dialogue with the world. Sometimes a site of interference sometimes a tactic, deep mapping is a Baradian diffractive apparatus for exploring the entangled states of limit and transgression. Or so it will unfold. . . 
    
My research-creation is driven by intellectual and spatial topoi which grasp and lure me forwards even before I comprehend where they lead. As such, my thesis is process rather than destination oriented. Its the story of my journey  navigating the field of possibilities opened up when A and B are recognized to be but place holders like latitude and longitude.  After all, iteration of a form reveals beginning and end to be merely places of turning and return.
