    RESEARCH-CREATION
    
    "
    research-creation suggests a mode of knowledge
production that does more than simply contribute to existing realms of
interdisciplinary and disciplinary data. Instead, without eschewing the
asymmetries of hierarchical disciplinary differences, it tumbles outside
of these intellectual frameworks, challenging practice/theory divides as
they police what gets to count as a valid object and method, within which
disciplinary framework, where, when, and how." pg 70 loveless

    MAKING SPACE for deep mapping
        How might spatial praxes that counter cartography be rendered without being flattened, georeferenced, or vectorized?
