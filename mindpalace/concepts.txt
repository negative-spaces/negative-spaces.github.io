            bricoleur as researcher being “arguably less governed by an overarching awareness that they are embarked on a ‘project’” but that “The idea that research might be conducted under conditions of aimlessness and without a clear objective in mind does not necessarily mean that it lacks the rigours of ‘accomplishment and execution’ but that much of what is fashioned in the process is contingent on factors that cannot always be foreseen."

Orientation/Disorientation
    (dare i include, map)
    Like many colleagues, beginning a graduate program meant moving to a new city, biome, country. I arrived in Vancouver on the unceded lands of Coast Salish First Nations, disoriented.  I graded sixty maps of downtown before I finally ventured there. [insert paragraph from lecture I gave but the contents of which I lost to the cloud pending account recovery on january 9th.]
    
    
    While Google Maps helped me get from A to B, the drive to locate and coordinate precludes disoriented discovery.     

        "It seems as though in the end, maps —the successful ones, the ones that show us where we are and get us from here to there —risk offering only two alternatives. They let us see too much, and hence blind us to what we cannot see, imposing a quiet tyranny of orientation that erases the possibility of disoriented discovery, or they lose sight of all the other things that we ought to see. They omit, according to their conventions, those invisible lines of people, places, and networks that create the most common spaces we live in today." (Laura Kurgan, 16-17 from Close up and at a distance)

    For me, orientation evolved not through memorizing a map but by developing spatial awareness through everyday practices of engaging with the city. 

    hot take: theorizing geography without practicing it is as ******** as a map of vancouver is at describing the city to a newcomer. 
        
        tentative posit: experienctial, practical knowledge has no exchange value

Praxis, Process, Practice 
Writing Geography, actually enacting knowledge production differently (Priti and Emily paper)
    Navigations of everyday life: 
        The importance of place is no secret to geographers, but of those whom I’ve met, few consider their everyday navigations as fieldwork. Following the charge for praxis to extend beyond study and actually enact knowledge production differently ( Narayan and Rosenman 2022) i demonstrate through this project a way of researching where the  field is not a site separate from the desk at which geography is written.
    "The rhythmanalyst will bring about many works himself by renewing the very concept of work" 35 --> challenging what _counts._ 
Practice Based Research
    *praxis based research
Research-Creation (Loveless, Trouman ed., ?Roussell?, )
    “Research-creation follows desire, and builds spaces and contexts that allow time and space to experiment in unpredictable directions… Research creation suggests a mode of knowledge production that does more than simply contribute to existing realms of interdisciplinary and disciplinary data. Instead, it tumbles outside of these intellectual frameworks, challenging practice/theory divides as they police what gets to count as valid object and method, with in which disciplinary framework, where, when, and how” (Loveless 71)

    “GeoHumanities…do not just require us to move beyond disciplinary silos; they also unsettle relations among theory, praxis, scholarship, practice, and application and undo the privilege of academic expertise. 

    … what might GeoHumanities do, and what might it mean to do the GeoHumanities? …radical because what is developed in the course of such work is not just new knowledge, but a set of reflections that take aim at the practices and processes of knowledge production themselves” (Hawkins et al)

    "The _creative_ aspect in creative humanities takes shape in the (literally) productive connection between making practices and thinking practices: making as/through thinking and thinking as/through making. These generative practices are emphatically experimental and comfortable with knowledge production in uncertainty, multiplicity, and friction. Thinking with, through, and beyond concepts, creative humanities projects are creative in designing, and developing their own methods and approaches as they seek to navigate and explore the productive connections and reciprocal relationships between the creative practices they engage with and develop conceptual analytical appraoches for what these practices also work with, through, or beyond."

                "Rhythms: the music of the City, a scene that listens to itself, an image in the present of a discontinuous sum" (45) ...is this contradictory to other arguments?

                rhythm implies measure (meausure being a calculated and expected obligation, a project - THESIS output)
                    "No rhythm without repetition in time and in space, without _reprises_, without returns, in shourt without *measure*.   But there is no identical absolute repetition, indefinately" (16)

                    rhythms as waves >> interfering 
                        in my research what does the constructive and destructive interference of linear and cyclical rhythms emerge as? 
                    rhythm exceeds measure for it ties over bars. in tension with time (signature) in syncopations which scorn down beats. silences, rests, they are part of the music, space contained within the score.

        on SCALE, briefly
             at what scale do you stop locating yourself in the universe?

        >Rhythmanalysis _in practice_ transforms presents into precences, instant(ce)s (n s) into continuums which exceed measure, are beyond the grasp of capital(ist) quantification.

        --> what does sponteneity do to time?
        --> what does serendipity mean within the context of time?
        does a practice guided by sponteneity and serendipity 
        connect somehow to slow scholarship?
