ON ORGANIZATION of
    CONTENT
        Structural organization: sections will be grouped under DEEP MAPPING as CONSTRUCTIVE INTERFERENCE a) with the basemap b) with established forms of knowledge production c) with accepted ways of rendering research public 
            { d) maybe something about rhythms, time, and iteration through theory and practice, though this can be covered in b) }
    FORM
        Multiple navigations will be offered which guide the interlocutor through sections contained within the above groupings in unique pathways.

            Certeau, Michel de. The Practice of Everyday Life. Translated by Steven Rendall. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1984.

                "His eleveation transfigures him into a voyeur... It puts him at a distance. It ransforms the bewitching world by which one was "posessed" into a text that lies before one's eyes. It allows one to read it, to be a solar Eye, looking down like a god. The exaltation of a scopic and gnostic drive: the fiction of knowledge is related to this lust to be a viewpoint and nothing more." (92)

                ..."Escaping the imaginary totalizations produced by the eye, the everyday has a certain strangeness that does not surface, or whose surface is only the upper limit, outlining itself against the visible." (93)

                >In the chapter Certeau outlines practices outside/counter to geometrical, panoptic, visual geographies and theoretical constructions... Beyond the surfice of the 2D aerial view of the city. 

                >Map --> tool of spatial/urban rhetoric

            Segway to deep mapping through de Certeau's footsteps --> practices of space

    SLOW SCHOLARSHIP/Process oriented
        Deep mapping is an exercise in slow scholarship: it takes time to know a place, to follow curiosity, to become lost. Light waves which penetrate the surface of a bubble take longer to re-emerge than those which reflect (off) the surface.
