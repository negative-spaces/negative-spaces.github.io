        Deep mapping eludes operationalization in its interpretive capaciousness, though disorientation is an excellent state wherein to begin. Deep mapping resists definition into methodology for it is <i>through the effects of practice that it becomes articulated.</i> My theory of deep mapping is therefore constituted <i>through my practice</i> of deep mapping. This page takes the form of a commonplace in which I think through practice by writing together (with) the physical and conceptual fields of my encounter. The width of the page is comprised of two equally spaced columns. Embedded on the left are digital scans tracing my material engagement with texts; on the right, elaborations in support of my interpretation of deep mapping. Instead of transcribing quoted passages from books and printed articles, I’ve scanned my marked-up readings and embedded them in the page so as to trace my process of thinking-together. This citational tactic makes visible the manner of assembling, analyzing, and writing with texts that works for my cognitive style. I dislike reading digitized books and articles as I struggle to retain content to memory unless I engage the piece in hand. Pinning a visual of my annotated hard-copy up on the screen reminds me what I was thinking while reading. Notes in the margins, crayon colors, wrinkles, stains––all place my reading. Iterative readings transform pages into palimpsests, sites marked by the [intra-active] dialogue of encounter. 
        <br><br>
        Mott and Cockayne (2017) call for conscientious engagement in citation as a performative practice for resisting “hegemonies of knowledge production and authority” (959) within the neoliberal university that reify white, cisgendered, heteromasculinist narratives. Yet their audience is primarily other professors (citing narrowly, they write, does a disservice to “our students”). What does conscientious engagement mean for graduate students, especially master’s students like myself who are new to a discipline? How do you cite widely when you’ve only been reading in and around a subject for two years and are lured by the work of non-geographers? How does one account for time constraints, expectations on bibliography length, breadth over depth? Conscientious engagement still stands, but might also include mention of how one happened upon a text (was it required/recommended reading or a serendipitous find?), whether it was read deeply or perfunctorily, and why its citation matters. Challenging content-oriented interdisciplinarity, Natalie Loveless (2019, chapter 3) suggests a polydisciplinamorous ethic that attends to how one relates to the various fields drawn upon and the ways in which one's research (form) forms kinship ties. Conscientious citation is not only about whom we cite but <i>how</i>. Forming of (intellectual) kinship ties as a praxis of solidarity is addressed by Natalie Oswin (2020), who calls for a “turn toward and for each ‘other’” (14). Writes Oswin,

          Geography as a field does not prioritize the material realities of differential embodiment. Epistemological pluralism too often amounts to epistemological unaccountability. ‘Others’ are set artificially apart, rendered isolated objects of study rather than knowledge co-producers, at best case material rather than scholarly interlocutors.

        I am reminded of a paper shared with me some time ago in which Therese Kenna states: “We have yet to effectively capture neurodiverse experiences of urban environments” (2022, 651). Kenna, a lecturer in urban geography, argues for the use of an intersectional analytic and geographical methods to understand “the social exclusion of those who are neurodiverse” (651) and advance a research agenda for urban planning and policy that accounts for and accommodates autistic persons. Since first reading this paper I have listened to Nick Walker’s Neuroqueer Heresies (2021), published a year before Kenna’s article came out. Below, I cite (as Walker encourages) her definitions of some key terms invoked by Kenna to articulate how Kenna’s paper, rather than turning for and towards an ‘other,’ others those whom she claims to advocate for. I follow this conscientiously critical engagement with my own experience of differential embodiment in the city and academy, discussing the material realities of having a kinetic cognitive style (also known as ADHD) as a graduate student and revealing citational form as a site for citational praxis.

            Neurodiversity is the diversity of human minds, the infinite variation in neurocognitive functioning within our species… Neurodiversity is not a trait that any individual possesses or can possess. When an individual or group of individuals diverges from the dominant societal standards of “normal” neurocognitive functioning, they don’t “have neurodiversity,” they’re neurodivergent. 
            <br><br>
            Neurodivergent, sometimes abbreviated as ND, means having a mind that functions in ways which diverge significantly from the dominant societal standards of “normal.” … Neurodivergent is quite a broad term. Neurodivergence (the state of being neurodivergent) can be largely or entirely genetic and innate, or it can be largely or entirely produced by brain-altering experience, or some combination of the two. Autism and dyslexia are examples of innate forms of neurodivergence, while alterations in brain functioning caused by such things as trauma, long-term meditation practice, or heavy usage of psychedelic drugs are examples of forms of neurodivergence produced through experience. 
            <br><br>
            Neurotypical, often abbreviated as NT, means having a style of neurocognitive functioning that falls within the dominant societal standards of “normal.”
            <br><br>
            A group of people is neurodiverse if one or more members of the group differ substantially from other members, in terms of their neurocognitive functioning.

            <br><br>
            At the root of the pathology paradigm is the assumption that there is one “right” style of human neurocognitive functioning. Variations in neurocognitive functioning that diverge substantially from socially constructed standards of “normal”—including the variations that constitute autism—are framed within this paradigm as medical pathologies, as deficits, damage, or “disorders.” 
            <br><br>
            Within the neurodiversity paradigm, neurodiversity is understood to be a form of human diversity that is subject to social dynamics—including the dynamics of oppression and systemic social power inequalities—similar to those dynamics that commonly occur around other forms of human diversity such as racial diversity or diversity of gender and sexual orientation. 
            <br><br>
            The crux of the matter is that the neurodiversity paradigm is fundamentally in alignment with the social model of disability (disability understood as the result of failures of accommodation, societal attitudes, and systemic barriers, which conflict with the needs, traits, and abilities of specific groups and individuals); whereas the pathology paradigm is inextricably entwined with the medical model of disability (disability attributed exclusively to medicalized defects located within the disabled individual, with the implicit assumption that status quo societal norms are more or less “right” and “natural” and that having traits and needs that are incompatible with those norms constitutes a personal deficiency).

          Kenna misuses the term ‘neurodiverse,’ repeatedly contrasting “individuals who are neurodiverse and neurotypical” (649). Individuals are not neurodiverse. Rather, individuals may identify as neurodivergent or neurotypical. A city is neurodiverse if it has both neurodivergent and neurotypical identifying inhabitants. Neurodivergence is mentioned only three times throughout the entire paper, once in the introduction in reference to the “various neurodivergent conditions that also need research attention” (646) and twice more as “other neurodivergent conditions” (648, 649). By collapsing discussion of neurodivergence to autism while maintaining consideration of the “multiplicity of neurodiversity” (646), Kenna renders marginal the embodied experience of other forms of neurodivergence such as ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, or as I prefer, Kinetic Cognitive Style), Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD), dyspraxia, dyslexia, dyscalculia, Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), Bipolar Disorder, and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).
          <br><br>
          Neurodiversity refers to  a diversity of neurocognitive styles, not “those who are neurologically different” (647). Different than what? All neurologies differ from one another. Assuming the pre-existence of a norm, Kenna remains unaccountable for her own role in the societal shaping of neurocognitive styles that count as ‘normal,’ and those differentially rendered as ‘other.’ There is no inherently normal neurocognition; to imply one such given marks neurodivergence as aberrant rather than part of the neurocognitive variation responsible for the neurodiversity <i>of</i> cities.
          <br><br>
          Kenna also pathologizes autism by continually referring to autistic persons as people <i>with</i> ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder). Autism and other forms of neurodivergence are no more ‘conditions’ than is neurotypicality. Moreover, Kenna’s entire research agenda is structured around her citation of autistic persons’ “persistent deficits” in social communication/interaction and executive functioning (649). By proposing solutions to “defects located within the disabled individual” (Walker 2021), Kenna’s paper perpetuates what Walker calls the pathology paradigm. Kenna’s statement “We have yet to effectively capture neurodiverse experiences of urban environments” (2022, 651) draws an artificial separation between “we,” the researchers and supposed article audience, and neurodivergents, the objects of study. Are “we” presumed neurotypical? Who decides the metric of efficacy and means of capture? Putting aside the incorrect usage of ‘neurodiverse,’ would not a project aimed at investigating the neurodiversity of cities include research into neurotypical experiences of the urban environment as well? 
          <br><br>
          In 2023, Kenna published another article on “neurodiverse experiences of the city” (370), this time reporting on a survey carried out in the fall of 2021 to neurodivergent inhabitants of Cork city, Ireland attending a local institution of higher education. Although Kenna continues to misuse the terms “neurodiverse” and “neurodiversity,” this paper cites significantly more forms of neurodivergence and attends thoughtfully to the relational aspect of disability. Disappointingly, however, Kenna self-cites her previous paper (2022) not to hold herself accountable but to reify the knowledge she produced prior. While both Kenna’s papers are speckled with citations, they are not a turn toward and for a neurocognitive ‘other.’ Instead, they relegate neurodivergent voices to case material––survey groups to be better accommodated rather than possible interlocutors or scholars themselves. Just because something is published in a peer-reviewed journal does not make it acceptable scholarship. I cite Kenna (2022, 2023) to model conscientious engagement beyond, enacting an interference with uncritical citations of an othering geography. 
          <br><br>
          I (re)turn now to my own work. I am a neurodivergent geographer dwelling in the city researching encounters and navigations of everyday urban life as sites of knowledge production. Assuming the social model of disability, I am not disabled in my experience of urban space because all my access needs for navigating around the city are met. 
        <br>
        However, as a neurodivergent graduate student in the academy, I am disabled. Institutionally established modes of knowledge production and form(at)s of rendering research privilege neurotypical cognitive styles, disabling ADHD graduate students like myself whose tactics and practices of investigation are often at odds with academic norms of  legibility and intelligibility.
