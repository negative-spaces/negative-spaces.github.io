The question of how we might render rhizomatic spatial praxes without linearizing, flattening, or georeferencing is one I’ve been walking with recently. Deep mapping as I conceive of it does not counter cartography. It is not defined by opposition so much as through acts of iterative intervention with the basemap, established forms of knowledge production, and accepted ways of rendering research public. The concept of deep mapping as constructive interference came to me while breathing with the ocean. The day was grey but at my feet I noticed foam forming bubbles on whose surface spun psychedelic spirals. This happens due to thin film interference, where light waves reflecting off the surface are interfered with by waves which have entered the film and re-emerged as refracted light. When refracted waves align with those reflected, they interfere constructively, intensifying the wavelength of light to make visible an abundance of colors. Deep mapping is constructive interference with the superficial reflection that is place rendered by flat maps. It’s situated, embodied inhabitation – a dialogue with the field of encounter. Off the page. Through everyday navigations.
