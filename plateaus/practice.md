## Refrain from elswhere
from [disorientation](./disorientation.md): **Spatial awareness** of my surroundings has evolved not by following Google's Map from A to B or memorizing its aerial contours, but rather through becoming lost and wandering around. Thus disoriented, I find areas of familiarity connected in surprising ways. Thus disoriented, I find areas of familiarity connected in surprising ways. I realize the city is not a fixed and inherently bounded object which pre-exists my encounter and which I, the geographer-researcher, may separate myself from in order to map from a distanced, exterior position. Rather, the city is physical-conceptual field whose emergent topology is performatively constituted through my everyday navigations. What if the field were not a site separate from where spatial analyses are produced, maps rendered, and urban geography written? Bringing this orientation to the ground, as praxis, means assuming the field of encounter (the city, as encountered if you will) as **interlocutor.** I invoke **research-creation** to initiate such a dialogue with the world, asking, *What could it mean to think *with* place, to *feel* the city?*

# Thinking through Practice 

I explore and respond to these questions through urban **deep mapping, a practice of situated, embodied inhabitation by which I enter into dialogue with my surroundings** 

Deep mapping is a spatial practice of situated, embodied inhabitation which assumes the physical-conceptual field of encounter as interlocutor.

Deep mapping attends to **spatial anthropology,** what Les Roberts (2018b, 30) calls an attempt to name "the processes whereby the fundamental spatiality of being is woven into and from everyday practices, dispositions and experiential knowledge. To proceed on these terms ... is to understand and practice space as an existential ground of everyday being." 

A mode of spatial analysis that accounts for rhythms that exceed measure, as they emerge in tension with time signatures; practical knowledge gleaned through practices of everyday life. layers that form depth of city inseparable - unlike discrete data layers loaded into GISystem for analysis, manipulation 

Deep mapping attends to **spatial anthropology,** what Les Roberts (2018b, 30) calls an attempt to name "the processes whereby the fundamental spatiality of being is woven into and from everyday practices, dispositions and experiential knowledge. To proceed on these terms ... is to understand and practice space as an existential ground of everyday being." 

Deep mapping does not render down to a map in the cartesian sense, where action is made legible by the substitution of trace for practice (de Certeau). Indeed, "very little of what deep mappers are doing is in fact oriented towards the production of maps so much as immersing themselves in the warp and weft of a lived and fundamentally intersubjective spatiality" (Roberts). 

**Space as practiced** crouch

>"**Leaving aside representation, ornamentation and decoration, art can become *praxis* and *poiesis* on a social scale: the art of living in the city as a work of art.** ...The right to the city manifests itself as a superior form of rights: right to freedom, to individualization in socialization, to habitat and to inhabit. The right to the *oeuvre*, to participation and *appropriation* (clearly distinct from the right to property), are implied in the right to the city. (Lefebvre 1996, 173-174, emphasis in original)
*connect elswhere: appropriation - tactics, detournement*
Topopoetics - Banazek, Cresswell, Magrane, de Leeuw, Acker

**Derive** - the Situationist exercise of drifting about the city and allowing oneself to be pulled by urban geography’s **affective contours** *Vignette: south granville, 2 streets, when you spend so much time you notice things -- sign speaking of bella, warehouse mystery, 15 minute city*

**Affect, balcony imaginaries, stories in garbage**
"How do we now describe the activity of sensual world-making, and what kind of theory is being built in this way?" (Stewart 2010) Deep mapping as attuning to affective atmospheres... "an atmosphere is not an inert context but a force field in which people find themselves. It is not an effect of other forces but a lived affect a capacity to affect and to be affected that pushes a present into a composition, an expressivity, the sense of potentiality and event. It is an attunement of the senses, of labors, and imaginaries to potential ways of living in or living through things" (Stewart 2010). "Attending to atmospheric attunements and trying to figure their significance incites forms of writing and critique that detour into descriptive eddies and attach to trajectories" (Stewart 2010, 452): Vignettes from practice are interspersed throughout the site. Constituting the empirics from fieldwork, I cite navigations and encounters from practice in the theory I convey here. 

        Alleyway wastelands- smellworlds of urban excrement 
        Discarded matters compile useless abundances. The decadence of disposal is ripe with contamination--the unsuspected juxtaposition of discordant discourses. Synthetic combustion brews acrid smoke. Styrofoam disassembles into decomposing shit. Refuse dissipates particularly, triggering visceral responses like scrunched nose stomach churn and walking quickly away. Garbage is composition awaiting compaction. But not everything cycles and nothing will become the same again. blurb on exploring commercial dumpsters as sites of implosion and assemblage, attending to ephemeral stories arising from the odor of urban excrement. I share vignettes in/formed by scraps gleaned through walking industrial alleyways and smelling assortments of garbage in Vancouver. By attending to spaces, subjects, and scents rendered other than desirable formations, I aim to refigure what matters are rendered in sensorial mappings of the city.

## Process Oriented 

Deep mapping is **research-creation** for my exploration is driven by intellectual and spatial topoi which lure me forwards even before I comprehend where they lead (Loveless 2019, 95). Following a concept in multiple directions I find myself making surprising connections. I write "follow" because when I loosen my desire to arrive at a specific place, when I release control of the destination as it were, I make room for latent connections to make themselves (apparent).  
    
Exploration, put one way, is ["the action of traveling in or through an unfamiliar area in order to learn about it"](https://bit.ly/3XeFxZw). **Deep mapping is a practice of learning through disorientation.** Though the field (city, discipline) is at first unknown and therefore unfamiliar, the iterative act of navigating, of finding ways around, coheres a framework of reference points which constitute am embodied topology - the field of encounter. 
    
```
My theory of deep mapping is constituted through my practice of deep mapping.
```

That sentence took nine months of writing and re-writing (iteration). Just that sentence, not my theory. Indeed, I wrote that sentence while my theorization was still taking shape. What I'd finally found were words to state how my theory, the knowledge co-produced, the link between theory and practice and the what of my entire project - all emerge from my iteration through theory and practice. Situated. Embodied. With/In place. 

>"...navigation itself produces knowledge that feeds into its course and experience itself." (Tuin and Verhoeff 2022, 137-139). 

Navigation makes navigable the field. To further describe the "iterative loops between action, experience, and knowledge" (Tuin and Verhoeff 2022, 138) which form my research (and whose form my research takes), I introduce the lemniscate: ∞ The lemniscate is a form I grew up drawing and walking as part of Waldorf pedagogy. Beginning in first grade 1, along with 20 classmates, learned form drawing and Eurythmy. Eurythmy is "visible speech, visible music" / "music translated into movement" (Steiner 1923) - a spatial practice accompanied by piano whose every class began by walking a lemniscate for nearly ten minutes. Facing forward we flowed as one body in continuous motion. Although eurythmy was, without exception, our least favorite block, I have no doubt practicing it twice a week for eight years significantly developed my sense of spatial awareness. Also beginning in grade one was the practice of form drawing. Sitting in silence for an hour or more we would draw a form like the lemniscate over and over, the crayon in constant contact with the page. Form drawing is process oriented: "It is the _act_ of drawing that educates, not the result" (Gebert 1987, 8). **The embodied iteration of patterns was a fundamental mechanism by which representational subjects like writing and arithmetic were later taught.** My critiques of Waldorf pedagogy notwithstanding, I attribute my acute spatial awareness and orientation towards sensorium to my experience of "multisensory learning, where ears and eyes and voice, hands and feet, mind and memory, all work together to reinforce each other" (Gebert 1987, 12).

*Other embodied practices and how they support deep mapping: playing viola (rhythm, dexterity and different hands doing different things together, breathing with orchestra, learning music by ear --> spatial memory) unicycling, teaching and practicing yoga*
Discuss deep mapping as **slow scholarship**; discuss also slow residency, fidelity to place (in conversation with Modeen and Biggs)

### Theorization from Practice
From my iteration through theory and practice by which I think together/with the physical-conceptual  fields of my encounter, offer an interpretation of deep mapping that serves for now, for this project:

```
deep mapping is a praxis of interference with hegemonic forms of engaging & representing place, producing geographic knowledge, and rendering spatial research public.  
``` 

"How we do, think about, think-with our research practices—be they written, spoken, or danced—matters" (Loveless 2019, 70). **This is what my thesis is about.** Not a map, counter-cartography, or operationalization of practice to method. About conveying knowledge generated through practice and of practice without operationalizing practice itself. *Elaborate and give dedication/what i am dedicated to doing - overarching story that's in the works*



Although I address rendering and tactics of gleaning and bricolage elsewhere, I note here that deep mapping does not render down to a deep map. Neither, however, does it counter cartography. I
