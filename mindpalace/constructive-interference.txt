        Is not constructive-interference a tactic? deep mapping a tactic?  tactics within tactics within tactic of intervention, of gaining depth... (iterative, spirals)

seems as though diffraction is praxis oriented --> requires the doing, the invervention; while reflexivity can be shown on the page alone, a mere ***reflection**

DIFFRACTION AS METHOD (barad)



what is resistance? 

Foucault --> counter conduct 
"inventively modify, resist or escape the ways in which we are governed" (http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/id/eprint/59644/1/Counter-conduct%20Special%20Issue%20introduction%20Final-1.pdf)
counter cartography -- explicitly in opposition to conventional cartography/cortographic practice
this --> not a counter cartography but a form of counter conduct
1990s --> counter /critical cartography
    prefix  popularized



Foucault: preface to transgression (1977)
    "The limit and transgression depend on each other for whatever density of being they possess: a limit could not exist if it were absolutely uncrossable and, reciprocally, transgression would be pointless if it merely crossed a limit composed of illu­sions and shadows... Trans­gression caries the limit right to the limit of its being; transgres­ sion forces the limit to face the fact of its imminent disappearance, to find itself in what it excludes" (34)

    "Transgression, then, is not related to the limit as black to white, the prohibited to the lawful, the outside to the inside, or as the open area of a building to its enclosed spaces. Rather, their relationship takes the form of a spiral which no simple infraction can exhaust. Perhaps it is like a flash of lightning in the night which, from the beginning of time, gives a dense and black in­ tensity to the night it denies, which lights up the night from the inside, from top to bottom, and yet owes to the dark the rtark clarity of its manifestation, its harrowing and poised singularity; the flash loses itself in this space it marks with its sovereignty and becomes silent now that it has given a name to obscurity." (35)

    "its [transgression's] role is to measure the excessive distance that it opens at the heart of the limit and to trace the flashing line that causes the limit to arise. Transgression contains nothing negative, but affirms limited being—affirms the limitlessness into which it leaps as it opens this zone to existence for the first time" (35)




Diffraction --> wave meets obstacle or opening --> passes through --> bends --> waves interfere --> diffraction pattern -- so constructive interference of deep mapping with the basemap (as superficial reflection) becomes a new wave and thats a form of diffraction. This connects to ---- counter --> negative space --> both exist and not in oppositon - omg 
    this is how its not in protest but both exist, not in opposition, indeed necessary? 

harraway: 
    "Diffraction does not produce "the same" displaced, as reflection and refraction do. Diffraction is a mapping of interference, not of replica­ tion, reflection, or reproduction. A diffraction pattern does not map where differences appear, but rather maps where the effects of difference appear. "  ‘Promises of Monsters’ p 70

        semantics: 
            "the contents and figures of a communication" (14)
            "Semantics is about contents and meanings, tropes and topics" (22)

        "My invented category of semantics, diffractions, takes advantage of the opti- cal metaphors and instruments that are so common in Western philosophy and science. Reflexivity has been much recommended as a critical practice, but my suspicion is that reflexivity, like reflection, only displaces the same elsewhere, setting up the worries about copy and original and the search for the authentic and really real. Reflexivity is a bad trope for escaping the false choice between realism and relativism in thinking about strong objectivity and situated knowl- edges in technoscientific knowledge.What we need is to make a difference in material-semiotic apparatuses, to diffract the rays of technoscience so that we get more promising interference patterns on the recording films of our lives and bodies. Diffraction is an optical metaphor for the effort to make a difference in the world. Lynn Randolph’s suggestive painting on the last page concludes Modest_Witness@Second_Millennium.FemaleMan©_Meets_OncoMouseTM with an interference pattern, not with a reflection of the same displaced elsewhere." (16)

        "Diffraction patterns record the history of interaction, interference, reinforcement, difference. Diffraction is about heterogeneous history, not about originals. Unlike reflections, diffractions do not displace the same elsewhere, in more or less distorted form, thereby giving rise to industries of metaphysics. Rather, diffraction can be a metaphor for another kind of critical consciousness at the end of this rather painful Christian millennium, one committed to making a difference and not to repeating the Sacred Image of Same. Diffraction is askew of Christian narrative and Platonist optics, in their sacred secular technoscientific story cycles as well as their more orthodox manifestations. Diffraction is a narrative, graphic, psychological, spiritual, and political technology for making consequential meanings." (273)

        "In an attempt to account for ontology (the ontological element of the past in general) and epistemology (accounting for subjectivity in a framework of societal and environmental developments that extend beyond human action, reparation and comprehension, but must not lead to the return of the Subject), I will innovate on interference patterning or diffraction as a methodology for capturing what I call ‘posthuman interpellation’. This methodology can account for the specific temporality and subjectivity that I try to bring to the surface in this article; the temporality and subjectivity at work in practices of knowing in being. There is something about the always/already affected cartography of, in my case, feminist new materialism, that compels methodological precision." (233-234)

Barad (Meeting the universe halfway pg 81):
    "Some physicists insist on maintaining the historical distinction between interference and diffraction phenomena: they reserve the term "diffraction" for the apparent bending or spreading of waves upon encountering an obstacle and use "interference" to refer to what happens when waves overlap. However, the physics behind diffraction and interference phenomena is the same: both result from the superposition of waves."
    ...
    So unlike the phenomenon of reflection, which can be explained without taking account of the wavelike behavior of light, ... diffraction makes light's wavelike behavior explicit...."

    "Reflexivity is a proposed critical scholarly practice that aims to reflect on, and systematically take account of, the investigator's role as an instrument in the constitution of evidence. Reflexivity aims to acknowledge the tripartite arrangement between objects, representations, and knowers that produces knowledge, as opposed to less-reflexive modes of investigation that leave the knower out of the equation, focusing attention narrowly on the relationship between objects and their representations. 
    ...
    Reflexivity takes for granted the idea that representations reflect (social or natural) reality. That is, reflexivity is based on the belief that practices of representing have no effect on the objects of investigation and that we have a kind of access to representations that we don't have to the objects themselves. Reflexivity, like reflection, still holds the world at a distance. 87
    In particular, calling a method "diffractive" in analogy with the physical phenomenon of diffraction does not imply that the method itself is ana­ logical.26 On the contrary, my aim is to disrupt the widespread reliance on an existing optical metaphor-namely, reflection-that is set up to look for homologies and analogies between separate entities. By contrast, diffraction, as I argue, does not concern homologies but attends to specific mate­ rial entanglements. 88\

    "reading through (the diffraction grating}

        subject, object contingent, not fixed 

        respectful engagement that attends to detailed patterns of thinking of each; fine-grained details matter"


    wow, cannot believe I came to these sources accidentally (serendipitously) at the end of december after thinking about this concept since March!!!
