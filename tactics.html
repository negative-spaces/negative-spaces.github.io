  <p>This section describes the tactics of deep mapping and why an eclectic toolkit of methods gleaned from what’s already around is best suited to interference. Tactics are methods whose validity is measured by their applicability to the situation at hand. Beginning with de Certeau’s differentiation of tactics and strategies, I argue that spatial analysis with geographic information systems (GIS) deploys strategy while deep mapping employs tactics. GIS are the computational programs, desktop applications, and infrastructural hardware that facilitate the distribution, visualization, and analysis of spatial phenomenon. Coordinates append location to place, codifying the city into vector graphics and pixel grids. Vertical negotiations are rendered down and rent apart into layers like streets.shp, waterbodies.tiff, and buildings.geojson. Even when every layer is added to the screen one atop the other, their sum remains an impalpable expanse. Deep mapping is a spatial practice of situated, embodied inhabitation which assumes the physical-conceptual field of encounter as interlocutor. Empirics emerge as inextricable layerings of sensorium, affect, and infrastructure through synesthetic attunement to the entangled viscera of urban bodies, human and nonhuman. Questions brought up in this section that I would explore further in another project are: How are empirics made legible as data by the apparatuses that produce them? How are technoscientific and affective orientations to ‘what counts as data’ constitutive an empirical account of the city? For now I return to the eclectic toolkit of the bricoleur-as-researcher and the tactics involved enacting my interference as praxis: in data collection (engaging with my surroundings), making data legible as research imperics (producing geographic knowledge), and c/si(gh)ting otherwise (rendering spatial research public). I trace patterns between “gleaning as spatial praxis,” practical knowledge and computational thinking. Draw from conversation between Foucault and Deleuze on Intellectuals and Power to demonstrate theory as a toolkit of tactics for transgression.

    The eclectic toolkit of a bricoleur is needed to expand the field from within, interfering with systems and structures which delimit intelligibility not through oppositional strategies but with tactics appropriate to the situation at hand.

            I return now to my own work as a neurodivergent geographer intent on feeling the city and assuming everyday encounters and navigation as sites and tactics of differential knowledge production. (When it’s all the field for deep mapping, everyday practices of living become fieldwork.) Much of my personal practice of urban deep mapping relies on walking and biking uneven terrain, modes of navigating the city that are not accessible to all inhabitants. Assuming the social model of disability, I am not disabled in my practical experience of urban space because all my access needs for navigating around the city as I please are met.  [working out how to phrase all I want to say here]
            <br><br>
            However, as an ADHD graduate student in the academy, I am disabled. Institutionally established modes of knowledge production and form(at)s of rendering research privilege neurotypical cognitive styles, disabling ADHD graduate students like myself whose tactics and practices of investigation are often at odds with academic norms of  legibility and intelligibility. Certain expectations govern progression through a graduate program: consistent cognitive capacity, swift processing and synthesis of new information, considerate executive function to initiate, respond, and follow-up with time-sensitive correspondence, social battery network with new people and maintain a growing number of relationships, tolerance of the status quo, etc., etc.. But progress is not always linear nor of consistent intensity or direction.

                    The city is hazy and so am I. I wake up late, spend till noon fighting the residual stupor of sleeping pills. Insomnia comes in waves; I pray it ebbs. I do five things at once without thinking: I wash the dishes while putting away glasses. I drop them all, I sweep them up and the faucet is still running. I try to eat. I choke. I'm unable to swallow like my body is rejecting input. I'm out of breath. My senses dulled. I'm lost in familiar places. I wander around listening to <i>You want it darker</i> on repeat. The mountains have  disappeared and even downtown is fading away. I think I've opened myself so wide to feeling this city
                    that when it's hazy so am I.

                     <br><br>
                    Early in the term Professor K made a joke in which she recalled a professor whose class was so hard, its difficulty was measured by the number of students who committed suicide. I was silent in the laughter that followed. Discussion resumed. I express now what I couldn’t find the words to say then: people die by suicide because they believe there is no possible way to go on. The hopelessness of students in the face of unrelenting academic pressure is not at all funny. Professor K’  humor revealed the prevalent conceptualization of “rigor” as difficulty to the point of impossibility. 
                    <br><br>
                    This mentality was evident in 520. With proper scaffolding and tactical provision, the progress report could have been a productive learning experience. Instead, it was an impossible task with an immutable deadline. I began wondering not whether I was capable of graduate school, but whether I even wanted to pursue it. I saw no way to continue within a system that required me to treat my self as a commodity.  Write the Great Lakes Feminist Geography Collective:

                      The business enterprise of academic life in the neoliberal university produces a work rhythm that is rushed, riddled with anxiety and pressure to be ever-present. Sometimes life gets in the way. Overwhelming pressures can lead to paralysis, and scholarship can come to a complete halt.” <sup>1</sup>

                    Something had to shift and if it wasn’t the system (just yet) it would have to be my relation to it. What I learned from writing the progress report was this: taking care of my body-mind is more important than meeting a deadline because the body-mind will break down long before the system. Sometimes, denying extensions puts a student in the position of feeling like there is no possible path forward. Putting students in a position so antithetical to learning is poor teaching and far from a joke. I didn’t ask permission to submit this journal late because I already gave myself permission to prioritize my health and wellbeing. That such boundary-setting on my own part should feel so radical reveals just how normalized the expectation is that students treat their body-mind like a commodity.

           Immutable deadlines can be disabling. Immutable deadlines do not necessarily produce rigorous scholarship. [ leading sentence] What if failing to comply after a best effort was made were not a personal failure but a systemic one. I am neurodivergent because I fail to conform to neuronormative performances of productivity and sociality, of making and doing, thinking and being. I can (a privilege) but as I grow older, masking is becoming increasingly uncomfortable and, to be stereotypically frank, unappealing.

            After great ordeal and personal expense, I registered with my university’s Center for Accessibility. I was registered with the Center for Accessibility at my previous institution, and my accommodations of extra time on exams and as-needed deadline extensions was incredibly helpful.  However, I don’t have exams as a graduate student. Accommodations for ADHD students typically cater to assignment oriented programs. There was little the Center could offer for a graduate student pursuing a long-term semi-structured research project. Indeed, the one and only accommodation I desperately needed––printed out hard-copies of course readings––was denied to me because it was not deemed an accessibility issue by the university. My department told me I could print at my own expense. I dislike reading digital books and papers as I struggle to retain content to my long-term memory without the text in-hand. <BR>
