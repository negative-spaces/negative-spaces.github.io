    Waves are all around us in the form of water waves, sound vibrations, and electromagnetic radiation. The waves of water and sound require a medium to move through, such as liquid or air, whereas electromagnetic waves do not. The sun emits electromagnetic waves that radiate through the vacuum of space. Visible light, responsible for the colors humans can see, comprises only a portion of electromagnetic radiation on the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum.  Radiation on the EM spectrum from longest wavelength to shortest goes: radio waves, microwave, infrared, visible, ultraviolet, X-ray, Gamma ray. A microwave appliance heats your food in minutes or less by radiating microwaves––whose wavelength is 100,000 times shorter than a radio waves, yet still 20,000 times greater than visible-to-humans light––into the food, exciting its molecules whose vibration results in heat. The spectrum of visible-to-human light ranges from red, whose wavelength is the longest, to violet, whose wavelength is the shortest. Though bees cannot see red, they can see ultraviolet light (Shipman 2011) which is just beyond the color violet perceptible to humans. Infrared radiation, whose wavelength is just longer than visible red, may be felt as heat. Infrared sensors are used for thermal imaging, night-vision apparatuses, and studying cloud structure among other things (National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Science Mission Directorate 2010a, 2010b). A portion of the sun's incoming solar radiation is reflected back outward by the earth as infrared radiation. Remote sensors on satellites collect data on reflected near-infrared waves which can be processed specific software to assess vegetation cover and crop health (National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Science Mission Directorate 2010b). I once did this in a remote sensing course I took during my undergrad in physical geography and geographic information science. In highschool, I had a wonderful environmental science teacher who explained how scientists can tell whether a star is moving towards us or away from us by the color of light it appears to be emitting. Similar to the Doppler effect characteristic of siren wails, when a star is moving towards us/Earth/the instrument of investigation, the electromagnetic radiation it emits becomes "scrunched up" in front of it, decreasing the wavelengths so that the visible light being emitted appears blue to the human eye. This is known as blueshift. When a star is moving away from us/Earth/the instrument of investigation, the electromagnetic radiation behind it becomes more and more "stretched out" and appears red to the human eye. This is known as redshift. In biology the following year I learned that plant leaves look green because in the process of photosynthesis, where sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide are transformed into sugar and oxygen within plant cells, wavelengths responsible for red and blue are absorbed whilst for green and yellow-green they are reflected. Waves are ambient, effecting what you see, feel, and hear in encounter with sensing/sensory apparatuses.

    When two or more waves occupy the same space in time they are said to be <span style="font-weight:500">superpositioned</span>. Superpositioned waves do not oppose one another but interfere, their displacements combining to produce a new wave. Constructive interference occurs when superpositioned waves are in phase with one another, meaning the crests and troughs of all waves align. Destructive interference occurs when superpositioned waves are out of phase, when crests from one wave align with troughs of another for example. The patterning of interference is called a <span style="font-weight:500">diffraction pattern</span>.

      Sometime in early pandemic quarantine, I performed a diffraction experiment of my own in a pitch-black bathroom for my undergraduate physics course. Using a laser pointer, I sent a beam of light through a piece of tinfoil with two razor-thin slits, both vertical and parallel to one another. On the wall beyond, a pattern of alternating bright and dark stripes appeared. I have recreated the set-up and detailed the experiment below. 
      <br>

      <!--double slit diffraction experiment vignette-->

    </div>
      
      <p>
        <br>
        Passing through the tinfoil, the laster beam is bifurcated by the double slit and spreads out as it emanates from both openings. What is rendered visible on the wall beyond is a diffraction pattern marking the effects of the interference of these two beams of light. The bright stripes on the wall mark where constructive interference occurred, constituting a new wave whose heightened amplitudes effect a brighter light. The dark stripes mark the effect of destructive interference, where superpositioned waves were out of phase, effectively canceling each other out. The observation of bright and dark stripes - kindly captured in my recreation by an interlocutor - was worth the postage required to ship DIY (do it yourself) kits across the country to quarantined undergraduate students because it illuminated light behaving as a wave. Why is this so noteworthy? Did I not begin this page talking about lightwaves? Well, light can <i>also</i> behave as a (subatomic) particle. A photon is a discreet physical quantity, or quantum, of the electromagnetic field; a photon is a quantum of light (Barad 2015, 395).  Particles occupy distinct positions in time and space, meaning two particles cannot be in the same place at once. Following this Cartesian logic, particles cannot produce diffraction patterns. Only waves can produce diffraction patterns because only waves can be superpositioned. But did we not just create a diffraction pattern with a beam of light? While light may behave as both wave and particle, it cannot be apprehended as both at once. That is to say, wave and particle are <i>entangled states</i>. 
      </p>
        
        <p>Now this entanglement isn't only characteristic of light. Experiments have shown that matter, for instance the negatively-charged subatomic particle called electrons, will produce a diffraction pattern under certain circumstances (Barad 2007, 83). The first double-slit diffraction experiment was conducted by Thomas Young in 1801, and the investigative setup has since been employed to explore such quantum entanglements as the wave-particle duality of matter. The wave-particle duality of matter means matter cannot be apprehended behaving simultaneously as both wave and particle. With this page, I introduce diffraction as a way to figure what is rendered of an interference practice such as deep mapping. I offer my first iteration at a theory of deep mapping, and situate my subsequent and current theorizations within the frameworks my thinking and practice have been read through. Because I have limited space and time - constrained as I am by the length and requirements of this degree project - this page serves as an account of initial patternings of interest: the entanglements of trace, practice, space, and place; the differentiation between human|nonhuman and field|researcher; dialogue figured as interaction and dialogue as intra-action; and the implications of posthuman performativity for thinking <i>with</i> place and <i>feeling</i> the city. All these and more I intend to pursue more thoroughly over the next four years of my PhD.

        Deep mapping disorients representationalist dualisms by assuming the field of encounter as interlocutor. In both deep mapping (practice) and making space for deep mapping (rendering), I aim to produce ‘situated knowledges’ wherein the object of knowledge is engaged as actor and agent (Haraway 1988, 592). Yet objects, much like places as we will see, are not preexisting entities but "boundary projects" whose "boundaries are drawn by mapping practices" (Haraway 1988, 595). Recall the cartography assignment introduced in <a href="./disorientation.html">disorientation.html</a>. Not only did tracing a map stand <i>in place</i> of spatial practice, the traced map stood in place of the map making practices which constituted it. The course assignment recommended a source statement, or credit, of "Google Maps". Such a citation effectively erased the illustration software with which the map was created, the computers on which the software ran, the internet connection and browsers which rendered Google Maps visible to screenshot, the lab instructions, my own directives and acquired technical expertise as course TA… in short, the entire material arrangement of the map’s production. Thus, the assignment irresponsibly reproduced a "gaze from nowhere" (Haraway 1988, 581) whereby the producers of geographic knowledge (in this case, the mappers) remained unimplicated in, and therefore unaccountable to, the boundary drawing practices entailed in rendering an object of knowledge (in this case, a place or was it the map?). Boundary drawing practices in this example are the tracing of downtown, choosing which streets to include and exclude, cropping the frame, naming labels and (land) acknowledgements. Additionally, a boundary making practice implicit to the source statement was that of differentiating the 'map author' as the intellecting actor and agent from (Google's map of) downtown Vancouver (assigned as the inert object to be mapped). I am partially responsible for the lack of situated knowledge, as I provided instruction during the lab sessions. While I did not write the lab assignments, in my 2nd and 3rd semester TAing the course I wrote rubrics where none had existed before. I evaluated students' maps based on their demonstration of technical skill rather than their responsibility for the partial story their representation conveyed.

    <br><br>
    In a shift away from geometric optics' visual metaphors that privilege a "fixed position", Donna Haraway (1991, 70) suggests diffraction. She writes, "diffraction is a mapping of interference, not of replica­tion, reflection, or reproduction. A diffraction pattern does not map where differences appear, but rather maps where the <i>effects</i> of difference appear" (Haraway 1991, 70, emphasis in original). Encountering the effects of interference actually led to my first iteration at a theory of deep mapping. The following is from January 2022, my first winter in Vancouver.

      <b>Site 4</b> Some grey day I walked the stretch of shoreline that wraps around the University of British Columbia. With the Salish Sea on one side and a forest of evergreens and sword ferns to the other, campus is geographically and administratively separated from the City of Vancouver. It also occupies the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam) people. A five-minute walk from the Geography Department takes me to a zig-zag staircase at the bottom of which awaits a place where clothing is optional. My shoes and socks are the first to come off. The sand is cold and firm, yet porous. It holds the impression of my soles and reshapes in my hands. I contain it for a moment, appreciating its texture, then let it go. 
      <br><br>
      Sunshine was a precious thing my first winter in Vancouver when it rained for four months straight. The cloud cover was so dense that a dimple of white was the only indication our star remained. Monochrome days used to really kill my vibe. There is a dullness to a landscape lit ambiently, a non-differentiation that makes it difficult to articulate thoughts. That day I paused at ocean’s edge where barnacles encrust the rocks and molluscs cling together in crunchy bundles. In and out rolled the waves, and I breathed with them. On each exhale I noticed how foam gathered around the rocks at my feet, forming bubbles on whose surface spun psychedelic spirals.

      <br>
      This happens due to thin film interference, where light waves reflecting off the surface of a bubble overlap with waves which have been transmitted through the film, reflected back, and refracted at the surface at the angle of incidence. When refracted waves are shifted so as to be in-synch with those reflected, they interfere constructively to make visible an abundance of colors (Cogverse Academy 2016). Deep mapping is constructive interference with the superficial reflection that is place rendered (down from above) by flat maps. Mapping deeply requires entering the landscape––putting one’s self into the field––and emerging to render a cartography beyond the monochrome.

    <br>
  <p>
    While walking False Creek that winter, I shared this idea with an interlocutor who recommended I read Haraway (1991) on diffraction. The limitation of geometric optics and its attendant reflections is further elaborated by Karen Barad (2003; 2007), who explains how diffraction can only be understood using physical optics. Importantly, whereas geometric optics relies on classical (Newtownian) physics, physical optics are explained using quantum physics. Unlike classical physics, quantum physics allows for superpositions, for entangled states. [segway/transition] What is needed to produce 'situated knowledges' (Haraway 1988) (of the place one inhabits) is not reflexivity on the part of the researcher, or merely an approach which <i>counters</i> the hegemonic one, but an account of <i>how</i>differences come to matter as the effect of boundary making practices. 
    </p>

    <p>
      In <i>Meeting the Universe Halfway: Quantum Physics and the Entanglement of Matter and Meaning</i> (2007), Barad attends to this by "building diffractive apparatuses to study the entangled effects differences make" (73). While not involving a laser pointer and tinfoil in a dark room, Barad's diffractive apparatuses are every bit as effective for generating diffractive phenomena. After reading Haraway on diffraction, I was googling for more writing coming from the humanities and social sciences when I encountered Barad's opus. It gave me a language to think about what it meant to theorize and practice everyday urban geography from <i>within and as part of</i> a city. I am thus beholden to this account my theory and praxis are so diffracted through. 
      </p>
      
      <p>Barad conducts a close reading of Niels Bohr's philosophy-physics to illuminate Bohr's complementarity relation as explanation for quantum entanglements, particularly the wave-particle duality of matter. Bohr's "<i>quantitative expression of complementarity</i>", or what Barad calls the "<i>indeterminacy principle</i>" (2007, 300, emphasis in original), shows a reciprocal relationship between "wave" and "particle" properties in a superpositioned state. Position and momentum, properties of particles and waves respectively, are indeterminate prior to their measurement. It is not that they are uncertain––that they exist but remain unknown because the act of measurement effects the recorded value, as Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle would have it––but that they do not exist to be known before the act of measurement. Barad underlines this as a shift from epistemic (uncertainty as a matter of knowing) to ontic (indeterminacy as a matter of being) (2007, 118, 127, and 300). Reading the writing of Niels Bohr and Michel Foucault through one another, Barad defines apparatuses as ongoing and open-ended material-discursive boundary making practices which resolve the indeterminacy of a property by performing an "agential cut" whereby the "agencies of observation" and "object of observation" are differentially articulated. "Agencies of observation" and "object of observation" are provisional configurations––entangled states which "intra-actively" mark one another within and as part of phenomena. Within the double-slit diffraction experiment recreated above, myself, equipped with practical knowledge of the experimental setup and interpretation, the dark room and smooth walls, as well as the laser, camera and photographer, tinfoil, Exacto knife, and binder clamps are marked as "agencies of observation" by the boundary making practice, or apparatus, through which the diffraction pattern is produced as an "object of observation". This distinction also presumes definite boundaries to all these measuring agencies, eliding the apparatuses responsible for <i>their</i> mattering. If memory serves, my undergraduate double-slit diffraction assignment required me to calculate the wavelength of the laser beam using the distance between the two slits, the distance between the tinfoil and the middle bright stripe on the wall, and the distances between the bright stripes, also known as fringes. A ruler and calculator, then, as well as an equation and practical knowledge solving trigonometric functions, were additional agencies of observation.
      </p>

      <p>
        But how are we to understand measurements? According to Barad's agential realism, "<i>measured properties refer to phenomena</i>…" (Barad 2007, 197, emphasis in original). Wave and particle are therefore phenomena within which momentum and position are made differentially determinate through apparatuses that constitute the mutually exclusive conditions for either property to become intelligible. What becomes intelligible is not an innocent matter, however, for the constitution of a determinate form entails the exclusion of all other/ed possible configurations. Objectivity, Barad avers, is not gained from a distanced position but from the agential separability enacted by intra-actions. Their use of 'intra-activity' is of specific consequence: 
        <!--Barad intra action quote-->
        <span class="quote">
          The notion of <i>intra-action</i> (in contrast to the usual 'interaction,' which presumes the prior existence of independent entities or relata) represents a profound conceptual shift. It is through specific agential intra-actions that the boundaries and properties of the components of phenomenon become determinate and that particular concepts (that is, particular material articulations of the world) become meaningful. Intra-actions include the larger material arrangement (i.e., set of material practices) that effects an agential cut between 'subject' and 'object' (in contrast to the more familiar Cartesian cut which takes its distinction for granted). That is, the agential cut enacts a resolution within the phenomenon of the inherent ontological (and semantic) indeterminacy. In other words, relata do not preexist relations; rather, relata-within-phenomena emerge through specific intra-actions. Crucially, then, intra-actions enact agential <i> separability</i>––the condition of <i>exteriority-within-phenomena</i> (Barad 2007, 139-140, emphasis in original)
        </span>
        <br>
        That is, the agential cut performed by an apparatus is what differentiates agencies of observation and object of observation, thereby producing the condition of exteriority within a phenomenon. It is through the exteriority <i>within</i> phenomena that a casual structure emerges where 'measuring agencies' ('effect') are marked by the 'measured object' ('cause') (Barad 2007, 337-340). Put another way, "<i>measurement is the intra-active marking of one part of a phenomenon by another</i>" (Barad 2007, 388, emphasis in original). The measurement of wavelength thus describes an intra-action between agencies and object of observation (detailed above) within and as part of the wave phenomenon. Because "measured values can be unambiguously and contingently attributed to the corresponding property of "objects-in-the-phenomenon" (not to some presumably independent object)" (Barad 2007, 465), the recorded wavelength marks objective data if and only if its referent is the wave phenomenon. Diffraction is therefore not a metaphor for Barad. For them, diffraction patterns mark the effects of <span style="font-weight:400">diff</span>erential int<span style="font-weight:400">ra-actions</span>. Diffraction patterns are marks on bodies, where what comes to matter is the result of boundary making practices, or apparatuses, which differentially articulate the world. In an agential realist account, "objectivity is a matter of accountability to marks on bodies…. Accountability to marks on bodies requires an accounting of the apparatuses that enact determinate causal structures, boundaries, properties, and meanings" (Barad 2007, 340). How might a source statement for the cartography assignment I taught be refigured so as to render the map an objective account of the city?

    That maps do not offer inherently objective representations of place will come as no surprise to those versed in critical cartography. Critical cartography is summarized by Crampton and Krygier (2006) as 1. the theoretical critique of cartography and 2. those maps that critique. Critique is not criticism, but rather the critical examination of an ontology’s evolution and assumptions with the aim of offering alternative possibilities (Crampton and Krygier 2006, 6). Examination of cartography reveals the following: maps are not neutral. Geographic knowledge is inseparable from power, and thus, the political (Crampton and Krygier 2006). I want to shift focus for now from (the very necessary and important) discussion of <i>what</i> is included and excluded by a given map to <i>how</i> different articulations of the world come to matter. More specifically, I am interested in the boundary making practices, or apparatuses, involved in different forms of engaging place, producing geographic knowledge, rendering spatial research. Accounting for apparatuses is important in order to remain responsive to <i>how</i> some bodies become privileged as legible subjects or intelligible formations while others are "excluded from mattering" (Barad 2007, 220).

    Thinking back to the course assignment's directive "your source is Google Maps", I wonder what specifically is being attributed to Google Maps? Note that the assignment required students to include a symbol representing BC Place (a stadium downtown), as well as a couple other points of interest. Therefore, Google Maps was not only referenced to trace land and water, streets and names, but locations as well. If we understand the objectivity of empirical formations to be contingent on accounting for the apparatuses by which they are constituted, then an account of how position is made determinate by Google Maps seems warranted. Google Maps exemplifies visualizing technologies which perform "the god trick of seeing everything from nowhere" (Haraway 1988, 581). The cartographer need never leave their desk. (Remember, I marked 60 maps of downtown Vancouver before I ventured to downtown Vancouver.) Google Maps provides the mapper interactive access to a 2-dimensional Cartesian representation of the earth's surface. The property of position is made intelligible within the Cartesian framework by a coordinate pair marking latitude (position north or south of the equator) and longitude (position laterally around the globe). Every point on Earth assumes a unique coordinate position. Cartesian cartography enables the representation of a 3-dimensional world by mapping coordinate points to 2-dimensional xy-coordinate plane. However, the location of a coordinate point on Google Maps is determined by the coordinate reference system used. Let me clarify with a brief description for workshop I recently developed on georeferencing historical maps (Demet 2024):

      Making Cartesian maps requires some method for flattening out the earth so we can represent it on our 2-dimensional computer screens. A Coordinate Reference System (CRS) defines this transformation. A CRS contains two components: a datum and a coordinate system.

      <span style="font-weight:500">Datums</span><br>
      Earth is not a perfect sphere but rather a spheroid as it is flattened slightly at the poles. Ellipsoid, referencing a 3-dimensional ellipse, describes the same shape. From Esri’s (2021) description: “While a spheroid approximates the shape of the earth, a datum defines the position of the spheroid relative to the center of the earth. A datum provides a frame of reference for measuring locations on the surface of the earth. It defines the origin and orientation of latitude and longitude lines.” A geocentric datum positions the center of the spheroid, aka ellipsoid, at the earth’s center of mass. A local datum “aligns its spheroid to closely fit the earth’s surface in a particular area.”

      Datums are developed using satellite data. A geocentric datums is useful when a map is meant to show the whole earth, such as a World Map or Open Street Maps’ web map. Local datums are useful when the area of interest is confined to a continent such as North America or a single country. Because local datums are accurate precisely for the area of their ellipsoid’s best fit, it would be unwise to use a local datum for a global map, or a datum specific to North America for Africa. Datums are named by their extent and survey year. Today, the most common geocentric datum is WGS 84 (World Geodetic System 1984), and the most common local datum for the United States and Canada is NAD 83 (North American Datum 1983).

      A coordinate system is the math governing the projection of points on an ellipsoid to a 2-dimensional plane. A coordinate system is either a Projected Coordinate system (PCS) or Geographic Coordinate system (GCS)....geographic coordinate systems plot points in decimal degrees, whereas the unit for projected coordinate systems is meters.

    I have put together a video below to visually demonstrate how the location of a coordinate point on Google Maps is contingent on the coordinate reference system used. I have chosen a Tim Hortons as my point of reference, though could easily have picked BC Place. First, I copy Google Maps' measurement of the position of the Tim Hortons which is 49.26384702 decimal degrees latitude and -123.140715 decimal degrees longitude. I then paste this coordinate pair into an excel spreadsheet, separating latitude and longitude into horizontal cells and labeling them above as "lat" and "long". Finally, I open QGIS. QGIS is an open source geographic information system (GIS) for analyzing, manipulating, and visualizing geographic information. Explains the QGIS user guide: "Just as we use a word processor to write documents and deal with words on a computer, we can use a GIS application to deal with spatial information on a computer" (“A Gentle Introduction to GIS” 2024, emphasis in original). First, I add Google Maps to my screen. This map essentially the same web map that may be accessed with an internet browser. I then load the coordinate for Tim Hortons. As you will see, it is located directly on the Tim Hortons indicated on Google Maps. This is because I am essentially matching the point located on the web-based Google Maps to that same map loaded into the QGIS environment. In both cases, Google Maps has the same coordinate reference system. But what happens if I change the coordinate reference system of my Tim Hortons data point while leaving my Google Maps basemap in its original one? Take a moment to watch and listen to the video below. I made this video by screen recording my computer while recording my voice on my phone. I emailed the audio recording to myself, and then combined the audio and video recordings with iMovie on my computer. I uploaded the resulting video to YouTube because the file was too large to commit to my Github repository.  I will include the video in my thesis zip folder.

    The position of a particular Tim Hortons near my home is first made determinate through my intra-action with Google Maps. The cartesian coordinates by which Google Maps locates a Tim Hortons near my home are determined to be 49.26384702 degrees latitude and -123.140715 degrees longitude. So long as the point shares the coordinate reference system of Google Maps, it will be superimposed upon the Tim Hortons as rendered by the Google Maps in QGIS. However, when I change the coordinate reference system of the point [49.26384702, -123.140715], Google Maps no longer locates it on the Tim Hortons. Although the measured value of position remains the same, the value assumes a different location because it is being rendered intelligible by a different coordinate reference system. The meaning of position in Cartesian representations of the world is therefore entangled with the coordinate reference system by which the representation[?] is itself rendered intelligible. Locations within Cartesian maps are therefore phenomena. The construction of situated objectivity in Cartesian cartography requires accounting for the coordinate reference system used. If none were used, for instance if the map were traced or hand drawn, the method of flattening and warping remains relevant. Although the course assignment did not concern students with coordinate points, the act of tracing Google Maps' points, lines, and polygons is a performative citation of a particular coordinate reference system. [and re-presentation of a specific phenomenon. something about marks on bodies???] Questions emerging as I continued to teach and practice cartography while deep mapping included: How is downtown produced as a place through the act of tracing a 'top-down' Cartesian representation of the city? How is place produced as such through the act of tracing? What is the relationship between a place as rendered by a tracing and that which is experienced and/or constituted by the everyday spatial practices of urban inhabitants? In future research, I will attend more thoroughly to the corpus of writing by geographers differentiating space and place. Throughout this project, however, my thinking on the matter has been most influenced by Michel de Certeau (1984). And so, I bracket a literature review in favor of exploring how de Certeau's figuration of space and place might nuance the above questions.

    In <i>The Practice of Everyday Life</i> (1984), Michel de Certeau relationally articulates space and place with the following: "<i>space is a practiced place</i>” (117, emphasis in original). He writes,

    Google’s map of Vancouver abides by the law of the “proper”. It produces the city as a place wherein each element has a distinct location. Position is made determinate by a spatial configuration which “excludes the possibility of two things being in the same location (<i>place</i>)” (de Certeau 1984, 117, emphasis in original). Such a static, Cartesian coordination allows for navigation to be routed (by Google) from one element to another. The navigational possibilities, however, remain determined (and constrained) by the law whose logic governs the map: follow streets, not alleys; walk on sidewalks; don’t jay-walk; turn right here, not at the next block. Disorientation is a destination not found by Google Maps, which asks in response, "Should this place be on Google Maps?"  (“Google Maps” n.d.).

    Yet de Certeau contends it is pedestrian movements that spatialize the city, writing, “space is composed of intersections of mobile elements…space occurs as the effect produced by the operations that orient it, situate it, temporalize it…” (1984, 117). While urban geographers and planners may theorize and design the city, urban space is produced through everyday navigations and encounters. If the apprehension of place renders position determinate, the motion that spatializes renders position indeterminate: “to walk is to lack a place” (de Certeau 1984, 103). Google Maps imposes the law of the “proper” upon navigation by substituting “a mark in place of acts, a relic in place of performances: it is only their remainder, the sign of their erasure” (de Certeau 1984, 35, emphasis in original). The relationship between place and space seems entangled with that between trace and practice. In <a href="./practice.html">negative-spaces/practice.html</a> I introduced the iterative spatial practices of eurythmy and form drawing I grew up practicing as part of Waldorf education. Each week, beginning in first grade, we would sit for an hour in silence drawing a single form over and over, our crayon in constant contact with the page. Writes form drawing teacher Rosemary Gerbert, "a form drawing is a present record of a past movement, the remaining trace of a finished gesture" (1987, 9). Tracing is a practice of (spatial) citation. Tracing is still practice. It is the trace which, once framed as the output, marks the effects of an interference practice and in so doing, renders the practice by which it was constituted unintelligible. Places, like objects of knowledge, are not preexisting entities but “boundary projects" (Haraway 1988, 595) drawn into being by boundary making practices such as tracing. If space, time, and matter are phenomena (Barad 2007), place is as well. Position may take on determinate values whose measurements which refer to situated locations rendered intelligible within and as part of a place phenomenon. The source of the map produced through the cartography assignment I TAed was not Google Maps' aerial view of the city but rather the practices of tracing and exclusion which constituted downtown as an object of observation. [i think im struggling bc theres both downtown and the map itself as objects of observation] Objectivity requires reference be made not (only) of Google Maps but the place phenomenon within which downtown Vancouver emerged as an object of knowledge.

    We live in a moment where locative technology is ubiquitous. Becoming lost no longer requires going out of one's way. Instead, "disoriented discovery" (Kurgan 2013) begins with a choice to not reference Google Maps, to turn location off and allow position to remain indeterminate. Reading Barad (2007) and de Certeau (1984) through one another, I believe place and space to be phenomenal expressions of the world differentially articulated through trace and practice. I am particularly interested in how pedestrian tracings of Google Maps––a locative technology which renders the city down from above as a place––inform everyday navigations and thus the production of urban space. How does Google Maps define intra-actions between humans and urban infrastructure, becoming part of dialogue with the urban surround it both enables and constrains? How are categories like human|nonhuman or field|researcher performatively constituted through embodied methodologies and sensory, more-than-human, and imaginative (Elliott and Culhane 2017) ethnographies? I wonder how posthuman embodiment might inform mapping practices in ways that reconfigure delimitations presumed by Google Maps. It is to these last two questions I now turn my attention.

    My fieldsite cannot be instantaneously apprehended as the nominal City, nor can it be captured by the frame of a single map. Neither has one disciplinary framework or methodology been sufficient to think through practice: each time I leave home I bring along an assortment of people/stories/theories I wish to think with for the day. I put them into conversation first amongst themselves. Heavy in my bag, their pages interlap, folding together like a pair of hands. Opening one, I open myself: Read me.

    Barad employs what they describe as a diffractive methodology to "think[] insights from different disciplines (and interdisciplinary approaches) through one another" (2007, 93). A diffractive methodology differs from a diffractive apparatus, for, as articulated above, apparatuses are boundary making practices not experimental setups, methods, tactics, or otherwise agencies of observation. Indeed, apparatuses are the very practices responsible for differentially articulating the agencies of observation and the object of observation within a phenomenon. Diffraction phenomena are at times the object of investigation, at other times, the apparatus of investigation, though never both at once (Barad 2007, 73). I understand engaging a diffractive methodology to be the negotiation of this entanglement––an exploration through the iterative interplay of generating interferences and studying diffraction patterns to understand how differences come to matter. Such has been the exercise of my master's research-creation. 
    </p>

    <p>Diffractive reading is about reading <i>through</i> rather than against: interference rather than opposition, diffraction rather than reflection. "Diffractive readings bring inventive provocations;" says Barad in an interview, "they are good to think with" (in van der Tuin and Dolphijn 2012). Drawing from Barad and Haraway, Murris and Bozalek (2019) develop propositions for guiding diffractive readings of literature. What I find most admirable is that they do so by putting Barad's diffractive methodology into practice. Their article marks the effects of their diffractive reading of 1. propositions generated through another exercise in diffractive reading, and 2. their article itself. Thus, in the process of formation, their article serves as a diffractive apparatus for generating interferences while what's rendered through publication is a diffraction pattern marking the effects of their interference practice. They write:

      <br><br>
    <span class="quote">
      The challenge in adopting diffraction as a methodology is not to <i>theorise</i> the diffraction pattern (a logic of representation), but to put it into <i>practice</i>, thereby disrupting the theory/practice binary. The idea is to read theory <i>with</i> practice diffractively guided by, for example, key questions that move the experiment forward. (Murris and Bozalek 2019, 1505, emphasis in original)
    </span>
    <br>
    This is what I have attempted to do in my master's research-creation by theorizing deep mapping through practicing deep mapping and enacting my theory as praxis in ongoing iteration. I encountered Haraway (1991) and then Barad (2003, 2007, 2012, 2014, 2015) a few months after I first theorized deep mapping as constructive interference. My thinking diffracted through agential realism, and I refigured my theory of deep mapping from constructive interference to interference in general (both constructive and destructive), for superpositioned positionalities need not be aligned nor must their interference amplify the value of some property. Writing this page in particular has urged me to think about the questions that drive my experimentation forward.  As Natalie Loveless (2019) asserts in her manifesto for research-creation, "<i>the crafting of a research question is the crafting of a story that is also the crafting of an ethics</i>" (95, emphasis in original). The framing of a question is a boundary drawing practice which influences the field of possible responses. Like any other page of my thesis (and my thesis itself), I did not begin knowing what it would be about beyond interference. Writing this page day after day has been a challenging practice, the effects of which are only just now coming into focus. At this point, I find that writing negative-spaces/interference.html is helping me think my research question through the theory I have metabolized since its inception.
  </p>
    <p>
    My research-creation asked, <span  style="background-color: #82ffd562">'What could it mean to think <i>with</i> place? to <i>feel</i> the city?'</span> 
  </p>

  <p>
    Responding to this question invites an exploration of what it might mean to think, to think <i>with</i>, to <i>feel</i>, as well as the boundary making practices involved in citing "place" and "the city" as interlocutors. Rather than offer any authoritative definitions, I diffract these questions (and by extension my initial question) through some of the physical-conceptual field of my encounter. Note: the goal of my master's research-creation was never to answer my initial question but rather to explore and respond to it through deep mapping. Therefore, my exploration and response to my initial inquiry and its attendant provocations has been, and continues to be, diffracted through the effects of my simultaneous exploration and response to the question, 'What is deep mapping?' 
</p>

<p>
  Recall my first theorization of deep mapping, formulated by thinking with the diffraction phenomena of thin film interference:
  <br><br>
  <span class="quote">
    Deep mapping is constructive interference with the superficial reflection that is place rendered (down from above) by flat maps. Mapping deeply requires entering the landscape––putting one’s self into the field––and emerging to render a cartography beyond the monochrome.
  </span>
  <br>
  What I was gesturing towards was how deep mapping was for me an interference practice, rather than one of opposition. It was in this sense that I became cautious of describing deep mapping as a counter cartography (see Mason-Deese 2020), for, to me, it did not seem to <i>counter</i> cartography so much as describe a practice aimed at articulating alternate possible spatial stories through interfering with those defined by totalizing abstractions. While I recognized deep mapping could not occur from a remove, I <i>did</i> assume a preexisting exterior to "the field" from which one stepped "into" the field and then "emerged". Such an initial conceptualization is unsurprising given the literature through which I came upon deep mapping. 
</p>

  <p>
    My first introduction to deep mapping was the work of Les Roberts which I encountered in 2020 during my undergraduate research into critical and creative cartographies. This was at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic had recently shuttered my undergraduate campus, forcing me into isolation in rural Maine. Roberts editorials (2016b, 2018c) for his two <i>Humanities</i> special issues (2016a, 2018a) were the first creative scholarly publications I ever read after Eric Magrane's <i>Climate Geopoetics</i> (2020). Immersed as I was in physical geography and geographic information science, deep mapping and the concept of spatial bricolage (see <a href="./tactics.html" target="_blank">negative-spaces/tactics.html</a>) seemed to offer just the open-ended and expressive form of fieldwork I yearned for. When the world as mediated through my phone became increasingly cacophonous, wandering the woods made more and more sense. I began leaving familiar pathways and cultivating spatial awareness guided by landmarks such as uprooted trees, wetlands, and boulders. I attended to alternate perceptual scales, kneeling to observe trumpet lichen pushing up from rotting trees and listen for water gurgling underground in spring (Demet 2021). Roberts (2016b) calls deep mapping "an embodied and reflexive immersion in a life that is lived and performed spatially. A cartography of depth. A <i>diving within</i>" (XIV, emphasis in original). Deep mapping, he elaborates in a subsequent publication, "presupposes the embodied presence of the researcher 'within' the space under investigation" (Roberts 2018a, 11). "Deep mappers", he writes, "immers[e] themselves in the warp and weft of a lived and fundamentally intersubjective spatiality" (Roberts 2018a, 51). Reflexivity is central to Roberts' formulation of deep mapping. Embodiment, by virtue of being in reference to the researcher, at once presupposes the differentiation of bodies human and nonhuman and enacts that distinction. David Crouch (2003) compares notions of embodied practice with those of performance and performativity to explore how identity is constituted through encounters with space. Crouch develops 'spacing' as a term which "identifies subjective and practical ways in which the individual handles his or her material surroundings. Spacing is positioned in terms of action, making sense (including the refiguring of 'given' space), and mechanisms of opening up possibilities" (Crouch 2003, 1945). "There is a particular sensuousness and a tactile way of knowing that is central to everydayness," he writes in a later publication (Crouch 2010, 64), though thinking and feeling remain human pursuits engaged relationally with "materiality and non-human life" (63). For Crouch (2003, 2010) as for Roberts (2016b, 2018a, 2018c), the human body is already differentiated from their nonhuman, material surroundings which are sensed and made sense of through an <i>embodied</i> positionality. For both, space is intentionally left nebulous, constituted at once as something an individual can be "'within'" or that which is "'given'", and also something lived, performed, and open to reconfigurations. Discussing vitalist geographies, Beth Greenhough (2011) writes, "space and time are brought into being simultaneously with the actualisation of a given phenomenon" (41). This may seem to echo Barad (2007), for whom space, time, and matter are phenomena (316) "mutually constituted through the dynamics of iterative intra-activity" (181). I am not as yet well versed in non-representational theory or the more-than-human turn, so cannot make generalized statements about vitalist geographies. I have instead attempted to read agential realism's posthuman performativity through this account of vitalist geographies and the handful of related literature I've read, marking similarities and differences in how agency and the human|nonhuman boundary are figured. I am particularly invested in how the apparatuses through which differential embodiment is constituted effect different possibilities for knowing. This is something I intend to further study during my PhD.
</p>

<p>
    For Greenhough, the vitalism of vitalist geographies extends "agency (the power to sense the world)...to all living beings" (2011, 41). What constitutes living beings is never articulated, however.  The boundary drawing practices by which living is differentiated from the nonliving and human bodies from those nonhuman remain unaccounted for. If sense is the capacity of living beings (Greenhough 2011), then the promiscuous self-touching of physical and virtual subatomic particles and the yearning with which they reach out towards one another (Barad 2012, 2015) can be adduced to illustrate how all matter is vital. "There is a vitality to the liveliness of intra-activity," Writes Barad, "not in the sense of a new form of vitalism, but rather in terms of a new sense of aliveness" (2007, 177). Agency in agential realism is not ascribed based on 'sense', 'living', and 'being', for such properties are themselves constituted through intra-activity and therefore are not intrinsic to an already individuated part of the word. Writes Barad, "human bodies, like all other bodies, are not entities with inherent boundaries and properties but phenomena that acquire specific boundaries and properties through the open-ended dynamics of intra-activity" (Barad 2007, 172). Thus, <i>Embodiment is a matter not of being specifically situated in the world, but rather of being of the world in its dynamic specificity</i>" (Barad 2007, 377, emphasis in original). Barad's posthuman performativity (2003, 2007) extends Foucault and Butler's analyses on the materialization of bodies by attending how matter itself comes to matter, and to the apparatuses through which human and nonhuman bodies are differentially constituted. Writes Barad (2007), "In an agential realist account, performativity is understood not as iterative citationality (Butler) but as <i>iterative intra-activity</i>" (184, emphasis in original). As noted earlier, rendering an intelligible form with determinate properties is a boundary making practice which necessitates exclusions. So, while vitalist geographies regard agency as the capacity to sense (Greenhough 2011), within agential realism's posthuman performativity, "agency is the space of possibilities opened up by the indeterminacies entailed in exclusions" (Barad 2007, 182).

  When I first began my master's I checked out <i>A Different Kind of Ethnography: Imaginative Practices and Creative Methodologies</i> (2017) from the library. This collection of thoughtful everyday interventions offered more open-ended engagement with the world than did Writing Ethnographic Fieldnotes (Emerson, Fretz, and Shaw 2011), a dense edition purchased for my required methods course (which happened to be in Anthropology). I admit I did not make it very far in the latter text. Perhaps I will revisit it during my PhD in which I will engage more 'human subjects', reading it diffractively through other approaches to data 'collection'. Dara Culhane (2017) contributes a chapter to <i>A Different Kind of Ethnography</i> on sensing. She writes, "Sensory ethnography not only privileges lived, embodied, and affective knowledge, but also focuses on intersubjectivity and the co-creation of such knowledge" (Culhane 2017, 60). Culhane understands affect as "feelings generated by––and, like embodiment, circulating through––relationships among people" (2017, 54). Moreover, "<i>Intersubjectivity</i> is the space of thinking/feeling/doing/being created by people interacting with each other in and through social relationships" (56, emphasis in original). Exercises for the reader to take out into the field are reflexive, privileging the human sensory apparatus. So long as affect is sensed from an already human embodiment, knowledge can only be co-created with humans by humans.

  'Place dialogue' (Adams and Kotus 2022) and 'lyric geography' (Acker 2019) gesture towards 'situated knowledges' of place in that their "object of knowledge is engaged as actor and agent (Haraway 1988, 592). Place dialogue assumes places as interlocutors and more-than-human agents; "Place dialogue is about the meaningfulness of embodiment in a place, and the way in which bodily responses to a place are acts of interpretation positioning place as an actor among actors" (Adams and Kotus 2022, 3). In this sense, place dialogue is sensory ethnography with place, rather than humans, as the subject. Recollecting her fieldwork for a PhD in geopoetics, Maleea Acker writes, "Place impels me; it is the actor. Place also unfurls around me; it becomes the subject" (2019, 132). Acker's lyric geography takes shape as a literary commonplace, her own writing on the left-hand pages in dialogue with human interlocutors on the right. Referencing her time in Ajijic, Mexico, she writes, "My geographical practice, similarly, acknowledges walking through places and charting my feelings and the ways in which I interact with people as both a creative practice and a turn toward dwelling at home, toward choosing to engage <i>with</i> place rather than to distance myself from it" (Acker 2019, 154, emphasis in original). This was the mentality with which I arrived to Vancouver. I first encountered Acker's work in <i>Geopoetics in Practice</i> (2019), an edited collection I read during my undergraduate thesis. The ideas/stories/people therein set the tone for my journey to Vancouver and the subsequent journey of working towards an MA in geography whilst getting to know the city of/through my inhabitation. Intentional engagement with place is cultivated as deep mapping by Laura Bissell and David Overend (2015), who turn to their daily commutes as a site for 'performative counterpractice'. Their attention is guided by four considerations: "first, convergences and divergences of paths and routes and their relationship to the boundaries and barriers that contain and define them; second, notions of becoming, changing and transferring; third, patterns and rhythms of commuting and ways of documenting and analysing these processes; and fourth, the corporeality of commuting as an embodied practice" (Bissell and Overend 2015, 484). Invoking deep mapping as "theory-informed story-telling" (476), their evocative account demonstrates the capacity of academics to redefine what counts as fieldwork by leaning into their everyday spatial practices as sites of knowledge production. For Bissell and Overend (2015), as for Adams and Kotus (2022) and Acker (2019), the intersubjectivity which assumes place as a subject also assumes place "as an entity" (Adams and Kotus 2022, 3), with preexisting boundaries and determinate properties which, with more concerted attention on the part of the human, will reveal themselves.  Intersubjectivity where place becomes the/a subject is still about discreet bodies interacting.

  As shared in <a href="./disorientation.html" target="_blank">negative-spaces/disorientation.html, </a>it was while commuting to campus with the 33 bus, an irregular route for me, that I realized the city is not a site with fixed boundaries and determinate properties which preexist encounter and which I, as inhabitant-geographer-cartographer, may irresponsibly separate myself from in order to map from a distanced, exterior position. Rather, the city is performatively constituted as a physical-conceptual field whose emergent topology is iteratively drawn through everyday navigations and encounters. As such, the city of my inhabitation and I are entangled, figured and continuously reconfiguring in dynamic relation. Writes Greenhough (2011): "fieldwork is more than a process of data collection; it is an event through which the researcher and the researched are resituated or repositioned in the world, and thereby are engaged in remaking the world through the process of their encounters" (48). Field and researcher, equipped as they are with tactics of investigation, are provisional configurations which intra-actively constitute one another within the entanglement of encounter. Murris and Bozalek (2019) continue:
    <br><br><span class="quote">
      As a researcher is one part of the world, hence a diffractive reading is unlike a literature review as the latter assumes that you are at a distance of the literature, having a bird's eye point of view - creating an overview by comparing, contrasting, juxtaposing or looking for similarities and themes. A diffractive reading, on the other hand, does not foreground any texts as foundational, but through reading texts through one another, comes to new insights. (1505-1506)
    </span>
  </p>

  <p>
    Though not foregrounding any one text, diffractive reading <i>is</i> "rigorously attentive to important details of specialized arguments within a given field without uncritically endorsing or uncondi­tionally prioritizing one (inter)disciplinary approach over another" (Barad 2007, 93). A diffractive methodology attends to the relational ontology of agential realism (Barad 2007, 389) rather than a flat ontology. Drawing from deep mapping literatures and practices, Springett (2015) offers the spatiotemporal descriptor of 'deep' rather than 'flat' to gesture towards the democratization of knowledge through enactments that retain an ethical and political bent by attending to social and ecological hierarchies. For her, deep mapping emerges as a performative practice for decolonizing the way people engage with place (Springett 2015, 634). Writing of Indigenous sound art, Sara Nicole England (2019) draws on Candice Hopkins' interpretation of 'deep listening' to explore attentiveness to noise "as a productive medium and gesture toward spatial decolonization" (20). In a colloquium presentation given at Simon Fraser University in 2019, Carcross/Tagish First Nation citizen Candice Hopkins describes a practice of decolonial listening:<br><br>
    <span class="quote">
      Decolonization as we know it is an active practice. It's a verb it's not a metaphor. It's a present process that echoes into the future. And I think that the way to begin with this, the way to bring people to this place, is to first listen to those who are here. So freeing some of the voices wedged beneath dominant history has the possibility, I think, to redress some of the violence that's reduced Indigenous people, Indigenous lives, to numbers and ciphers and fragments of discourse. And perhaps by dwelling in these fragments, by spending time in the discomfort of the incomplete, of listening to the shards that often now stand in for history, it's possible to tune our ears to hear something of these stifled voices. The politics of colonial entanglement offer the possibility not only to hear what is sounding but also to listen to the silences as well. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt1SBjDCJco" target="_blank"><i>Towards a Practice of Decolonial Listening: Sounding the Margins | Candice Hopkins</i></a> 2019, 19:33-20:32, punctuation added)
    </span>
    <br>
    England (2019) considers how the unconscious differentiation of sound from noise reveals a value judgment through which the listener marginalizes sounds they find unintelligible. Rejecting harmony, England asks, "might listening to noise suggest an attentiveness to difference?" (2019, 16). Citing Hopkins' description of "noise as a cacophony" and Jack Halberstam's contextualization of cacophony within colonial structures (see Halberstam 2013), England writes, "Attending to cacophony, then, is at once a recognition of intelligible structures and a transgression of them" (2019, 16).
  </p>
    
  <p>
    Herself a settler on unceded Indigenous lands, England understands participating in Indigenous-led projects as a way to situate her academic research (England 2018). I am a settler on the unceded and ancestral territory of the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam), Sḵwx̱wú7mesh (Squamish), and səlilwətaɬ (Tsleil-Waututh) Nations, carrying out my research practice within and as part of a settler colonial city and institution of higher education. Producing situated knowledges thus necessitates attention to the ways in which my research is entangled with the settler colonial history of Vancouver and the University Endowment Lands, as well as ongoing dispossession. I recognize that this remains a conspicuous silence in my current work. As I continue to think and practice deep mapping over the next four years of my PhD, I am committed to reading, citing, and thinking with more decolonial geography and Indigenous scholarship related to place making and spatial navigation. I recognize I have much to learn of the history of Vancouver and this place before colonization. Additionally, since much of my focus surrounds everyday navigation and encounters with urban infrastructure, future research will include a more thorough examination of the ways in which First Nations are also actors and agents in the urbanization of Vancouver's landscape. For example, near where I live, construction has begun on an 11-tower apartment development on Squamish owned land spearheaded by the Squamish First Nation in partnership with Westbank (Cyca 2024; “History of the Sen̓áḵw Lands” 2024). Ian Biggs describes deep mapping as an 'essaying' of place that is about "<i>interweaving</i> many disparate, tensioned strands of experience, genres of writing, knowledge positions and narrative perspectives so as to produce a richer, more resonant patterning of meaning while retaining the pleasures of discrete threads within the larger whole" (Biggs 2010, emphasis in original). Like a diffractive reading, such an interweaving remains cognizant of differences while feeling for resonances.  Something about this for decolonial deep mapping of urban ecology here.
  </p>

  <p>
  In <a href="./disorientation.html" target="_blank">negative-spaces/disorientation.html</a>, I wrote that deep mapping eluded operationalization in its interpretive capaciousness (Roberts 2016; Modeen and Biggs 2020). This is not to say that theories and practices of deep mapping are never dissonant. Contrasting two publications on deep mapping Modeen and Biggs (2020) mark a distinction between approaches which are "literalist and instrumentalist" and those which are "scholarly and creative" (Modeen and Biggs 2020, 52). Interestly, both publications share many of the same citations. It comes as no surprise that the authors of the "literalist and instrumentalist" approach who wrote "A deep map is . . . an environment embedded with tools to bring data into an explicit and direct relationship with space and time" (Bodenhamer, Corrigan, and Harris 2015, quoted in Modeen and Biggs 2020, page) went on to publish an edited volume concerned with articulating methods of making deep maps (Bodenhamer, Corrigan, and Harris 2021). Modeen and Biggs (2020) choose <i>Deep Mapping</i> (2016), the <i>Humanities</i> special issue edited by Les Roberts as their "scholarly and creative" exemplar. As discussed in the preceding section, my thinking and practice are deeply diffracted through Roberts' work. However, reading Barad <i>through</i> my understanding of deep mapping as influenced by Roberts has led to me think more carefully about boundaries and how they are drawn. Given my hesitation to identify with either capacious approach to deep mapping laid out by Modeen and Biggs (2020), I wonder if my interest in posthuman embodiment may be indicative of a third strand of deep mapping practice, one which remains scholarly and creative while not presupposing the existence or intelligibility of formations such as human, space, time, data, or the field. That is, perhaps such entities can only be objectively referenced as entangled states, the researcher equipped with tactics of investigation within and as part of specific phenomena within which such boundaries become differentially articulate and properties determinate. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Similarly, data from field research is not the result of an individuated researcher using their a toolbox of theories and methods to collect information that was <i>already there</i>, simply awaiting recording. Rather, empirical formations are articulated through the boundary making practices of a research process, where field and researcher (equipped with instruments of investigation) emerge as agentially separate bodies iteratively intra-acting within and as part of numerous phenomena (e.g., an encounter, qualitative data analysis, a research project, the academy, the city, the world). Luke Bergmann (2016) - speculative data here → will write given more time in revision process! - describe geo-atom → then geo-interpretation. "differences among geo-interpretations should not be understood as mere "uncertainty" around a measurement of a single objective property but potentially as indicative of deeper ambiguity or polysemy" (977). 
  </p>

  <p>
    What I meant by 'deep mapping eludes operationalization', and where I am resonant with Modeen and Biggs' (2020) scholarly and creative approach, is that practice of deep mapping cannot be reduced to a sequence of ordered steps. To do so would be to  foreclose the "poetics of paradox and ambiguity essential to open deep mapping" (Modeen and Biggs 2020, 53). If anything, contrasting views illuminate how deep mapping cannot be captured by any single strategy, even as self-proclaimed cognoscenti cl/aim to define one.

 Post qualitative inquiry refuses the capture of method entirely; it "must be invented, created differently each time… The goal of post qualitative inquiry is not to systematically repeat a preexisting research reprocess to produce[sic] a recognizable result but to experiment and create something new and different that might <i>not</i> be recognizable in existing structures of intelligibility" (St. Pierre 2021a, 6, emphasis in original). It was through writing her dissertation that Elizabeth St. Pierre first encountered the incommensurabilities between humanist qualitative methodology and poststructural theories (St. Pierre 2018, 603). St. Pierre (2018) describes how normalized it was in graduate school to first pick a set of (qualitative) methods with which to gather data, then apply the theory one was reading to the data gathered. Upon reflection and the thinking immanent to writing, St. Pierre realized her methodological choice to conduct in-person interviews valorized a speaking subject, presence, and the primacy of language in a manner antithetical to the theory she sought to apply. In short, St. Pierre discovered "conventional humanist qualitative methodological concepts like <i>interview</i>, the <i>field</i>, and <i>data</i>" (2018, 606, emphasis in original) to be unintelligible within her poststructural theoretical framework.

  I have encountered a similar conundrum in making sense of data as it is made legible by geographic information systems (GIS) and Cartesian cartography on the one hand, and embodied spatial practices and sensory methodologies on the other. It began with question sparked by a panel concerned with infrastructures and affective orientations of data. Reading the panel's call, I realized data was taken for granted as an empirical formation. So I asked myself what <i>is</i> data? Much of my deep mapping fieldwork has involved navigating Vancouver, my empirics emerging as inextricable layerings of sensorium, affect, and infrastructure. During my thesis research I have worked as a Teaching Assistant for a departmental cartography course, completed GIS research assistance, and performed freelance cartography. I also continue to work in the university library Research Commons, where I teach and consult on geospatial matters. One of the workshops I led last year was on building walkability indexes with QGIS (“Network Analysis,” 2023). Geospatial data are data for which a locational property, such as coordinate or street address, is measured. A walkability index is a quantitative assessment of the relative accessibility of amenities within a delineated area. The library's workshop assumed as its empirics geospatial datasets which render the city down from above as a collection of points, lines, and polygons. Indeed, it was possible to make the index without any reference to on-the-ground, everyday navigations. Given geospatial data representing Vancouver's city blocks, population density, and amenities, GIS provides the tools to analyze proximity and connection, as well as visualize the result through a map.

  I began drafting my response to the panel's call overlooking the mudflats beside the Tsleil-Waututh Nation community and village site. Today, the Maplewood Flats provincial conservation area and wild bird sanctuary occupies the traditional and unceded territory of the Tsleil-Waututh Nation (“Visit Maplewood Flats” 2024). On a log bench overlooking Parkland's fuel refinery (“The Burnaby Refinery” 2023), I wondered: How are empirics made legible as data by the apparatuses that produce them? How are technoscientific and affective orientations to ‘what counts as data’ co-constitutive of an empirical account of the city?

  Writes St. Pierre (2018), "I had certainly "collected" official "data" during official "fieldwork," but data appeared in dreams, in my body, and in memories" (606). Some nights I continue to unfold a thought in my sleep, organizing and reorganizing the paper I was working on during the day. One morning I scribbled on a post-it:
<br>
</p>

<!--dreams data-->
<div class="vignette" >
  3 nights now I've woken 3 hours after falling asleep, the conceptual debris which all day circled my mind in an undifferentiated cloud suddenly cohered into orbits such that fully formed sentences carry me from unconscious to consciousness. delta brainwaves.

  <p>
    St. Pierre (2018) describes writing an "aside" about a dream she had involving her study participant. The last sentence she wrote, or which she "did not intentionally write—<i>it wrote itself</i>"  was "The aside is the field" (St. Pierre 2018, 605, emphasis in original). This became the refrain (Deleuze and Guattari 1987) of St. Pierre's dissertation. Long before I encountered postqualitative inquiry, the refrain of my master's began as 'It's all the field'.

Not only is my theorization of deep mapping diffracted through my practice of deep mapping and my praxis of deep mapping diffracted through my theorization of deep mapping, my practice of deep mapping is diffracted through every other practice I've undertaken past and present.  [don't know if I should go into details] Like St. Pierre, "I made the field as I  wrote" (2018, 606). I am reminded of how Eric Magrane speaks of geopoetics:</p>

  I resonate with St. Pierre (2018), drawing from Richardson (1994), that "...writing is also an empirical field of inquiry" (605). As I write this section, the section above is loosely mapped out but uncertain. With a ballpoint pen I write in the margin of the St. Pierre piece: "Is a diffractive reading the most generative way to engage 'incommensurable' methodologies?" Are technoscientific and affective orientations to engaging place, producing geographic knowledge, and rendering spatial research public incommensurable precisely because they have mutually exclusive onto-epistemologies, i.e. "descriptions of human being, language, discourse, power, agency, resistance, freedom, and so on" (St. Pierre 2018, 603)? The above mentioned panel on infrastructures and affective orientations of data invited "interventions at the intersection of space and data, exploring critical geographies and the city to offer critique, alternatives, and grounds for resistance to top-down practices for imagining and managing today's cities" ("177. Infrastructures and Affective Orientations of Data" 2023). Thinking with my ongoing work in Cartesian cartography, GIS, and deep mapping, I have grown critical of academic framings that render so-called 'top-down' and 'bottom-up' mapping practices in opposition to one another. Both are boundary making practices for configuring worlds. What matters is the effect of their differential articulations of what gets to count––what is included in the frame of an empirical formation. 'Top down' and 'bottom up' mapping practices simply perform different agential cuts, the effects of which do not oppose one another but overlap in the everyday, their interference constituting the entangled viscera of urban bodies as they are rendered differentially intelligible. A perhaps more generative way of relating incommensurable orientations could be to read them through one another. This means recognizing the entanglement of technoscientific and affective orientations to engaging place, producing geographic knowledge, and rendering spatial research public. The wave-particle duality of matter reveals entanglements to be the "poetics of paradox and ambiguity essential to open deep mapping" (Modeen and Biggs 2020, 53). Cacophony is a diffraction pattern marking the interference of  incommensurable intelligibilities. Entanglement is touching is "a cacophony of always already reiteratively intra-acting stories" (Barad 2012, 206-7). Mapping interference is ongoing and open-ended practice of reading/listening/sensing for the effects of difference.
