        LEARNING THROUGH DISORIENTATION
        <br><br>
        <br>
        <a name="learning-through-disorientation" id="learning-through-disorientation"></a>
        I have come to understand being a geographer as less of an ability to know where you are in space at all times and more of a capacity to learn through disorientation. Like many colleagues, I began graduate school in a place I’d never been before and where I didn’t really know anyone. As teaching assistant for a departmental cartography course, I was responsible for introducing and evaluating assignments, as well as demonstrating the use of required software. The first assignment: to make a map of downtown Vancouver by tracing a screenshot from Google Maps in Adobe Illustrator. I graded sixty of these maps before I finally ventured to the place they represented. Having now inhabited Vancouver for two years and taught this assignment nine times, I find Google’s basemap incongruous with my mental map of the city drawn from practical experience. Navigational maps, writes Laura Kurgan, “impos[e] a quiet tyranny of orientation that erases the possibility of disoriented discovery. . .” (2009, 16-17).

      Spatial awareness of my surroundings has evolved not by following Google's map from A to B or memorizing the trace of its aerial contours, but rather through becoming lost and wandering around. Thus disoriented, I find areas of familiarity connected in surprising ways. . .

          I take the 33 bus to campus on a whim. I'm running late to teach and I don't want to deal with the hassle of Broadway construction. <i>Why have I never taken the 33?</i> I wonder as a 5 minute walk brings me to a deserted stop. I sit on a bench in the sun to catch my breath. The 33 is one of the smaller buses. Its seats have that soft fabric patterned like a roller rink carpet. Riding the 33 is outside my routine. Its route takes me through places I've been before but have never connected by this route. I write these thoughts in the white space of a book I brought with me - <i>A History of My Brief Body</i> by Billy-Ray Belcourt.

        Some time later I boarded the 99 B-Line with Critical Concepts for the Creative Humanities. I was in a rush to leave and grabbed it spontaneously from the pile of books on my kitchen table because it fit in my coat pocket and also because each concept is a 4 page read - the time it takes to ride the 99 Bus 2 stops west along Broadway. It opens in my lap to where I'd hastily tucked an IKEA crayon. A concept I'd been thinking about all day but had yet to visit in this book: Navigations.

          [ scan of entire navigation concept - would be useful] <br>
          ...navigation entails the production of a performative cartography of a terrain, field, or domain that is constituted in the very act of its exploration. (Tuin and Verhoeff 2022, 137-139).
          <br>

        <br><br>
        Exploration, put one way, is <a href="https://bit.ly/3XeFxZw">"the action of traveling in or through an unfamiliar area in order to learn about it."</a> Though the field (city, body of academic literature) is at first unknown and therefore unfamiliar,   <a href="edies/iteration.html">iterative </a> navigation coheres a web of spatial relations that serves as reference. This is how I conceive of a mental map. Unlike google’s two dimensional map that directs me from A to B, mental maps develop through disorientation and are comprised of "those invisible lines of people, places, and networks that create the most common spaces we live in today" (Kurgan 2013, 17).

      THE CITY
      <br><br>
      <a name="the-city" id="the-city"></a>
      The city is not a fixed and bounded site which pre-exists my encounter as geographer-researcher and which I may separate myself from in order to map from a distanced, exterior position. Rather, “the city” is performatively constituted as a physical-conceptual field of encounter whose emergent topology is drawn through everyday navigations. As such, the city and I - field and researcher - are entangled, continuously figured and reconfiguring in dynamic relation.
