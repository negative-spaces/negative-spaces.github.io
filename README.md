What does it mean to think with place? To feel the city? My research is a praxis-based investigation into how the city as a field of encounter is constituted through everyday navigations. It explores how deep mapping––a practice of situated, embodied inhabitation––generates practical knowledge of an urban geography. Thinking together/with the material-geographical and neural-conceptual fields of my encounter, I theorize deep mapping as destructive interference with flat maps, established forms of knowledge production, and institutionally accepted forms of rendering research public.
