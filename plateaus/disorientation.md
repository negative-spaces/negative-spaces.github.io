"the bricoleur... is arguably less governed by an overarching awareness that they are embarked on a ‘project’, and that, correspondingly, they are performing in compliance with a clearly defined set of ‘aims’ or ‘objectives’. The idea that research might be conducted under conditions of aimlessness and without a clear objective in mind does not necessarily mean that it lacks the rigours of ‘accomplishment and execution’ but that much of what is fashioned in the process is contingent on factors that cannot always be foreseen." roberts 2018


I have come to understand being a geographer as less of an ability to know where you are in space at all times and more the capacity to learn through disorientation.

I began graduate school in a place I’d never been before and where I knew no one. -Come from physical geography, GIST to human geography program but ???
In the midst of a global pandemic I left rural Maine in the northeast corner of the United States an. For the first time in my life I didn't plot out a route beforehand. Had I planned the summer, I certainly wouldn't have accounted for a farmer stint in Oregon or doing freelance cartography from my makeshift desk in an old schoolbus. Three months after setting out, I crossed the border into Canada on the opposite side of the continent and drove into Vancouver.

 In my application statement to the University of British Columbia I wrote: I am a renaissance student whose skills in the arts and sciences unite in Geographic Information Science. My research interests lie in GeoVisualization, Critical Cartography, and the Geohumanities. I value both qualitative and quantitative methodologies, and am especially drawn to the ways both practices supplement each other. The research streams Digital Geographies, Geospatial Analysis, GIS and Knowledge, Ideas, Practices are both of interest to me for I seek the technical skills to map transdisciplinary patterns, not just conceptualize them. While my undergraduate background is in the physical sciences, I am fundamentally a creative whose passion lies with critical examinations of people, their interaction with each other, and response to the natural and built environment.

For seven months I lived in Dunbar, a neighborhood of mostly single family homes amongst which mine stood out. The backyard was a rambling garden bed with a sagging clothesline and blackberry briars that would catch at my  arms and face as I pushed through to the alleyway. Seven people lived there - a range of ages, personalities, and lifeworlds often in dissonance. I had little energy to explore walking the neighbhorhood. I found Vancouver to be hilly and the streets are organized into a grid. This makes crossroads and cardinal directions - north south east west - a primary way of communicating your location to others. There are a lot of public beaches and parks and many people commute by bike. I biked to campus through the fall and winter in rain and cold and darkness. At the end of the winter I moved east, away from campus and almost directly under the Google Map's drop pin for the City of  Vancouver.  I didn't know how deeply where you live can influence your thinking until I moved. A weight lifted. The city seemed to expand and life teemed with possibility.

<span id="quote">It seems as though in the end, maps–—the successful ones, the ones that show us where we are and get us from here to there–—risk offering only two alternatives. They let us see too much, and hence blind us to what we cannot see, imposing a quiet tyranny of orientation that erases the possibility of disoriented discovery, or they lose sight of all the other things that we ought to see. They omit, according to their conventions, those *invisible lines of people, places, and networks that create the most common spaces we live in today.*" (Kurgan, 16-17 from Close up and at a distance, emphasis mine)

"It is true that the operations of walking on can be traced on city maps in such a way as to transcribe their paths (here well-trodden, there very faint) and their trajectories (going this way and not that). But these thick or thin curves only refer, like words, to the absence of what has passed by. **Surveys of routes miss what was: the act itself of passing by.** The operation of walking, wandering, or "window shopping," that is, the activity of passers-by, is transformed into points that draw a totalizing and reversible line on the map. They allow us to grasp only a relic set in the nowhen of a surface of projection. Itself visible, it has the effect of making invisible the operation that made it possible. These fixations constitute procedures for forgetting. **The trace left behind is substituted for the practice. It exhibits the (voracious) property that the geographical system has of being able to transform action into legibility, but in doing so it causes a way of being in the world to be forgotten.**" (de Certeau 1984, 97, emphasis mine)</span>

Spatial Awareness of my surroundings has evolved not by following Google's Map from A to B or digitally tracing its aerial contours, but rather through becoming lost and wandering around. Thus disoriented, I found areas of familiarity connected in surprising ways...

Vignette: getting to wise 3 different ways, taking 33 bus
<!--include picture of book-->
 I take the 33 bus to campus on a whim. I'm running late to teach and I don't want to deal with the hassle of Broadway construction. Why have I never taken the 33? I wonder as a 5 minute walk brings me to a deserted stop. I sit on a bench in the sun to catch my breath a moment. The 33 is one of the smaller buses. Its seats have that soft fabric patterned like a roller rink carpet. Riding the 33 is outside my routine. Its route takes me through places I've been before but have yet to connect via this navigation. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hFzr9fGVitxUUCBwU75iWqKm5lluiB0_P2ErVb4HPZg/edit?usp=sharing">cut out part here about wise and intertextuality and writing in ns of story - see</a>
 <br><br>
 More recently I boarded the 99 bus - describe bus . With me I have - Critical Concepts for the Creative Humanities- which I brought this book because each concept is but a few pages - the distance between City Hall and MacDonald if you ride the 99 along Broadway. It opens to where I'd hastily tucked a crayon, to a page I'd never before been: Navigations. 
<br><br>
 "...navigation entails the production of a performative cartography of a terrain, field, or domain that is constituted in the very act of its exploration" (Tuin and Verhoeff 2022, 137-139).
<br><br><br>
            
Exploration, put one way, is <a href="https://bit.ly/3XeFxZw">"the action of traveling in or through an unfamiliar area in order to learn about it."</a> >>Though the field (city, discipline) is at first unknown and therefore unfamiliar, the iterative act of navigating, of finding ways around, coheres a framework of reference. 

>"...navigation itself produces knowledge that feeds into its course and experience itself." (Tuin and Verhoeff 2022, 137-139). 

<i>It coheres through iteration. Navigation makes navigable the field.</i>
Just as navigating the geographical field articulates a mental map of physical space navigations within a conceptual field articulate a theoretical framework - a cognitive conceptualization of an emergent web of connection at which my ideas tug and pull.  Following a concept in multiple directions I find myself making surprising connections. I write "follow" because when I loosen my desire to arrive at a specific place, when I release control of the destination as it were, I make room for latent connections to make themselves (apparent).
 
I realize the city is not a fixed and inherently bounded object which pre-exists my encounter and which I, the geographer-researcher, may separate myself from in order to map from a distanced, exterior position. Rather, the city is a physical-conceptual field whose emergent topology is performatively constituted through my everyday navigations.  As such, the city and I are figured and refigured in relation, a continuous tranformation that is never quite complete. 

If this process forms my research interest, where do I locate my fieldsite? And what constitutes my fieldwork? These questions led me to investigate my thesis itself - process itself, aims, output. 
what are my empirics and how do I collect data?  read/cite literature? methods internal to making do...
in so doing, exploring where and how the boundaries of intelligible research forms are drawn in academia - what is othered in a/counts of lebible and valid ways of producing geographic knowlege and rendering spatial research?  520 What is at stake in interfering from within - in s/citing differently? I think through these questions while riding the bus, walking the bridge, presenting my research at a conference and to my department. I find answers along the way, often by way of serendipitous encounters arising from spontaneous detours. citeSERENDIPITY PIECE? --> bricoleur having stumbled on a project, begun before thye knew it..... roberts

 <!--SIDE NOTES Releasing the certain destination in favor of disoriented discovery creates space and time to experiment in unpredictable Research-creation follows desire, and builds spaces and contexts that allow the time and space to experiment in unpredictable directions. " (70 )-->
Releasing the certain destination in favor of disoriented discovery creates space and time to experiment in unpredictable directions(2)My research-creation is driven by intellectual and spatial topoi which lure me forwards even before I comprehend where they lead(3). What could it mean to think *with* place, to *feel* the city? Approaching the field of encounter as interlocutor, I initiate an ongoing and open-ended dialogue with my surroundings through deep mapping, a practice of situated, embodied inhabitation. My thesis is about deep mapping, my practice, theorization through practice, and enactment of theory as praxis. 

I articulate how deep mapping not only marks where the boundaries of intelligibility are drawn but refigures them, valorizing ways of being and operating in the world (and academy) which are systemically relegated to negative space, to that whose othered existence is necessary for upholding the definition of the intelligible form. The site for deep mapping is therefore evershifting and no one methodological strategy will suffice. An eclectic toolkit of a bricoleur is needed to expand the field not by opposition but from within, interfering with systems and structures which delimit intelligible through oppositional strategies but tactics of interference.
